So. Who here has **project ideas**? And among these ideas, some turn into... uh, actual tasks, right?

Ok ok, so, get me a structured plan, broken down tasks, and anything resembling order. Like, right NOW!

Yeah...it's ok. We've all been there 😛.

The wasteland of unorganized thoughts is a dangerous place. But worry not — I built us a bunker.

## Welcome to the Bunker 🏚️

[Task-O-Matic](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic) is an AI-powered task management system with a post-apocalyptic survival bunker theme (because why not?). It takes your chaotic project ideas and turns them into structured, executable task lists through AI assistance.

Think of it as your personal task commander in the aftermath of project anarchy.

## What it actually does 📋

Task-O-Matic isn't state of the art — I'm not a bloody AI researcher — but it *does* work. And it's rather useful for us bunker dwellers:

- **Idea to PRD** : Take your half-baked idea and let AI turn it into a proper Product Requirements Document
- **PRD to tasks** : Break that PRD into actual, doable tasks
- **AI-powered enhancement** : Let the AI improve, split, and plan your tasks
- **Multi-AI generation** : Run multiple AI models in parallel and compare results (battle royale style)
- **External tool integration** : Connect to Opencode, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and more
- **Benchmarking** : Test different AI models with git worktree isolation
- **Existing projects** : Attach Task-O-Matic to projects you already started (`init attach`)
- **Local-first** : Everything lives in `.task-o-matic` (the bunker's archives)
- **Hierarchical breakdown** : Subtasks, sub-subtasks, sub-sub-sub... you get the idea
- **Streaming responses** : Watch the AI think with reasoning tokens

## The tech stack 🔧

Built with tools that survived the apocalypse:

- **TypeScript** — type safety is survival safety
- **Bun** — fast (needed when running from generators)
- **Vercel AI SDK v6** — the magic behind the AI curtain
- **Commander.js** — CLI parsing (I know a thing or two about CLI tools...)
- **Inquirer.js** — interactive prompts (for bunker decisions)
- **Zod** — schema validation (don't want corrupted data in the archives)

## Quick start ⚡

Oh, I know you're impatient. (Me too...)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic
bun install
bun link
task-o-matic init attach
task-o-matic prd generate "Build a survival bunker dashboard"
task-o-matic prd parse
task-o-matic task enhance --all
task-o-matic task execute --ai claude
```

Done.

## Installation 🔨

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic
bun install
bun link
```

Or via npm if you prefer the old ways: `npm install -g @dimitrigilbert/task-o-matic`

## Configuration 🔑

Task-O-Matic needs API keys. Set them as environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Put these in `.env` or your shell profile. Don't commit them to git, obviously.

## How it works 🚀

### Initialize

```bash
task-o-matic init attach    # attach to existing project
task-o-matic init new my-project   # or create new
```

Creates a `.task-o-matic` directory. Like your bunker's storage room.

### Generate a PRD

```bash
task-o-matic prd generate "I want to build a personal finance tracker that works offline, syncs when online, and has dark mode because bunker lights are harsh"
```

The AI will interview you (via inquirer prompts) to clarify requirements and generate a proper PRD.

### Parse into tasks

```bash
task-o-matic prd parse
```

Breaks down your PRD into hierarchical tasks, subtasks, sub-subtasks. Organized by priority and dependencies.

### Enhance and plan

```bash
task-o-matic task enhance --all
task-o-matic task plan
task-o-matic task split --id task-123
```

### Execute

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --ai claude
task-o-matic task execute --all --ai claude,gemini,gpt4
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --tool opencode
```

The AI reads the task description and context, generates code or documentation. You review before committing.

## Multi-AI 🤖

Run multiple AI models in parallel:

```bash
task-o-matic task generate-multi \
  --id task-123 \
  --providers claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --compare
```

See different approaches. Verify the best solution. Like having a council of AI advisors in your bunker 😊

## Benchmarking 📊

```bash
task-o-matic benchmark run \
  --models claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --task-set my-tasks
task-o-matic benchmark results
task-o-matic benchmark compare --run-id run1,run2
```

Uses git worktrees. Clean environments. No contamination!

## Local-first storage 💾

Everything lives in `.task-o-matic/`:

```
.prds/           # Product Requirements Documents
tasks/          # Task definitions and status
history/        # Execution history
benchmarks/     # Benchmark results
config.json     # Your configuration
```

No cloud. No data leaving your bunker (unless you choose to). Your data, your rules.

## Streaming with reasoning tokens 🧠

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --stream
```

Shows reasoning tokens as they're generated. Fascinating to see how the AI approaches problems (sometimes in ways I wouldn't expect, which is good).

## Why the bunker theme? 🤔

I know, I know. It's weird. But here's the thing:

1. It's fun 😛
2. Projects feel like chaotic wastelands
3. A structured system feels like building a safe shelter
4. "Bunker" is a great metaphor for local-first, isolated development
5. Why not?

Also, calling users "citizens" and projects "missions" makes me chuckle. If it makes you smile too, then it's worth it.

## Current status 🚧

Task-O-Matic is at **v0.1.5-beta.1**. Things might break. Features might change. But the core functionality works.

If you find bugs (and I'm sure there are nests of them), open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic/issues). I'm the only user right now, so finding bugs is becoming... challenging 😊

## What's next? 🔮

- More AI provider integrations
- Web UI (because some people prefer graphical interfaces)
- Team collaboration (multi-bunker coordination)
- Plugin system for custom tools
- Better dependency visualization
- Task templates for common project types
- CI/CD integration

Subject to change based on what the wasteland throws at us.

## Get involved! 🤝

This is a side project I built because I needed it. If you find it useful, that's awesome. If you want to contribute, even better!

Star the repo. Open issues. Submit PRs. Share it with other bunker dwellers.

## Final thoughts 💭

Task-O-Matic isn't going to revolutionize project management or anything grand. It's just a tool I built to help me (and hopefully you) turn chaotic ideas into organized, executable tasks.

It's not perfect. It's not the most elegant code I've ever written. But it works. It's useful. And it's mine.

If you're drowning in project chaos and need a structured approach to breaking things down, give it a shot. Worst case, you'll have a cool CLI tool with a bunker theme.

Best case, you'll actually ship that project you've been thinking about for months.

Stay safe out there in the wasteland, citizen. And happy coding!
