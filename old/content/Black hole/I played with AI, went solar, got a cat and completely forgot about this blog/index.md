## 8 months !

Heeeyy, this ain't too bad !? isn't it ?!! Come on 8 months's O.K. ! And I'm back with comments, must be worth somethin' :D, right ?!

My small big brain got overloaded with many things, I'm gonna recap a few of them so you get where I'll go with the content for the next while ;).

### Solar power baby !

If you have around 400€ to "spare/invest" and room for them on the ground, there is absolutly no excuse not to get a couple of panels and a plug and play micro inverter !

I'll write about it much more in depth in later articles, but the gist of it is the following, I have 4 DMEGG 440W bifacial panels plugged on 2 micro inverters.

Because it was too easy, I set myself some challenges, life's so simple, so why not add some, uuh ... ? ...

And guess what ? I used bash to solve 'em XD ... coming soon !

### Knock knock, who's there ? AI !

AI who ? Heeeeyyy I would like to still have a job in the future...

Bad humor aside, I am both amazed and terrified of what is happening in the field of AI and because I am hardware poor, I shilled a few coins to play around with ChatGPT and Claude this summer.

I still write most the words on here (unless stated othrwise ! ), don't worry about that !

But, I coded a bit with ChatGPT and later with Claude 3.5, and I have to say, wow !

Let"s be extremely clear :

* do I think AI create great code on its own ? NO !
* do I enjoy coding with chat AI ? Heeeellll nooo ... it is SOOOO frustrating !
* do I have concern over privacy ? Not to be pedantic, but I'll answer with a question : have you used the internet recently ?

All that, most of the time ... for now ... !

The key point here being the later ! Sometimes, it's not that far from "perfect", good looking bug free code, great insigth or suggestion and all that...

I'll probably talk about that in the future. Also I'll introduce you to Parseval, you'll see, he's a good "lad" !

Then, I'll write about my coming experience with Aider and Claude API as I plan to refactor/redo StationIO using this combo.

I'll cap my spending at 25€ as to make sure I do not ruin myself financially ;).

If conclusive, expect more AI experiments in the future ;)

### Oooohh, she sooo cute..., mmmmh...

And then I had a new furry companion, and right now she's saying "I haz need much cuddles" ^^

### A comment system for the blog

Nothing much to say here, I use [Uterance](https://utteranc.es/), works great and was absurdly easy to set up !

Yes, you'll need a Github account, 'm Sure ain't gonna do no auth meself, 'tis a static site, and anyway, most of y'all got a github account.

If you have a static site without comments, you should give it a try !

## What else ?

I still haven't worked on my new homelab install cause I suffer from a bad case of "if it ain't broken, don't fix it"..., like... I have my stationIO db and scripts, my jelyfin install, and so on... I will have to get to that at some point...

On a different subject, I would also like to print PCBs for my weather stations so as to make one for outside, I might even buy a rain metering apparatus (or maybe 3D print it...) if funds are suffecient.

I also have a few ideas involving automation, my solar installation, gardening, cooking... All or part of them at a time ! You might see all that if I ain't caught back by the procrastination monster... ^^, will see i guess.

Thanks for the read ;)

See you around and happy coding !
