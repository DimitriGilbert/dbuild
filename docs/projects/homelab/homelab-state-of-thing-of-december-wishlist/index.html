<a class=tag href=https://dbuild.io/tags/rpi/>rpi</a></div></div></header><div class=post-content><div class=post-cnt><p>I have been toying around with RPIs for years, got a original Model A with a whopping 512MB of ram and the (slooooow) 700Mhz single core cpu. It served me (and my flatmate then) well as a media center for a couple years, then I moved around a bunch and when I settled back (years after), it was time for the RPI 4.</p><h2 id=what-do-i-have>What do I have</h2><p>That is what I have right now, a 4 . I considered an 8 GB model, but considering my use case, I&rsquo;d probably run out of punch before filling the 8 gigs of ram.</p><p>It boots off of a usb ssd and has 2 external (NTFS&mldr;) drives connected. I also have a DaC pro 2 from hifiberry and it displays out of a cheapo generic 1080p projector I bought from the jungle site on my wall. Yes, it is fine. I watch the occasional DVD so it is fine. I sure would like better but, meh, no coins for that.</p><h2 id=coming-soon-hardware>Coming soon hardware</h2><p>A PI 5 8 gigs should be here before december. It will replace the pi 4 for all on premise stuff. The bump in power justify the 8 GB in my opinion, and with that bump will come a few more software that I will run.</p><h2 id=more-powa-more-softwa>More powa&rsquo;, more softwa'</h2><p>I&rsquo;ll have that for sure, we&rsquo;ll see how the pi behaves with this kind of load.</p><h3 id=a-git-server>A git server</h3><p>This is not the place to explain why I&rsquo;m starting to be kind of careful with Github, but I am.</p><p>So just as a precaution, I will run a git server thing on the updated homelab, you&rsquo;ll have to wait for the article to know which one ;).</p><h3 id=cd-stuff>CD stuff</h3><p>I&rsquo;d like to (re-)dip a toe in continuous delivery stuff. It&rsquo;d help keep my StationIO deployement up to date, build this site automagically, handle recurring task on my (way too) many projects, do whatever, the sky is your oyster (or something) !</p><p>If I could eliminate as much sysadmin as possible, hell I&rsquo;d love that !</p><h3 id=a-personal-cloud-thingy>A personal cloud thingy</h3><p>I didn&rsquo;t pick one yet but OwnCloud, NextCloud, whatever. I might try a bunch and make content about that ^^.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to be able to simply store/backup documents, access them from outside sometimes, I want a REST api and easy external sync for back up that&rsquo;s pretty much it.</p><p>Bonus points for apps (photo management, document edition, etc&mldr;) and plugins, but not necessary.</p><h2 id=a-door-to-the-world>A door to the world</h2><p>&ldquo;Soon&rdquo;(tm), I should have a fiber connection and should have athe perks thats comes with that,</p><ul><li>a static(ish) IP</li><li>bandwith</li><li>more bandwith</li></ul><p>This means, I&rsquo;ll be able to open some of my services to the world.</p><p>I want a PiHole, a VPN and use it as a relay for my weather stations, git server and the cloud thingy to be able to acces them from outside.</p><p>In the mean time, my sister&rsquo;s kids are getting older. They just got their first decent computer and start to venture online and I would like to keep them safe, I&rsquo;ll probably end up routing all traffic through me (VPN) with drastic mesure (the great wall of Didi)</p><p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll install a few FOSS for social media and communication needs to use with their friends as instagram, FB, X or whatever ARE NOT allowed for now.
Kids are mean and parents are dumb (and/or inverselly proportional), so, yeah, I&rsquo;m a fascist (the great wall and stuff ^^), whatever you&rsquo;d like, yeah, they&rsquo;ll probably suffer from something else, but at least, not that.</p><h2 id=mypi-a-toolbox-for-my-raspberry-by-homelab>MyPi, a toolbox for my raspberry by homelab</h2><p>Of course, I created a <a href=https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/MyPi>project</a> for that.</p><p>TLDR is I want to automate install and maintainance on my Pi, I could have used Ansible or something but I wanted to do it myself using Bash as much as possible.</p><p>Nothing fancy for now:</p><ul><li>install/update software using apt, docker and git</li><li>add entry to the fstab</li><li>add entry to the nfs exports</li><li>create folders</li><li>get metrics about the pi (temperature, ram, etc&mldr;)</li></ul><h2 id=what-now->What now ?</h2><p>You can expect a bunch of articles about <a href=/projects/mypi>MyPi</a>, the different software I&rsquo;ll use, how I&rsquo;ll use them, scripts creation to make life easier. More random content probably, haven&rsquo;t decided yet.</p><p>Definitly some sort of avant calendar (not daily) regarding homelab creation.</p><p>Thanks for the read and I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D )</p><p>See you around and happy coding !</p></div></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
