That, was, fun !</p><p>Ok, C++ ain&rsquo;t fun, but, you have so many libraries (of various quality, sure, but) that comes with great examples, a few copy and paste, couple of tweaks, boom, you got yourself a working prototype, it is just awesome !</p><p>Soon enough though, I got tired of copy-pasting. Keeping different boards (I started to have a few weather stations around the house) in sync was a pain. I wanted to have a common code base, and just a few lines of code to change for each board.</p><p>Born was ESPStation, it died quickly when I realised how much I knew of C++, so I started again from scratch, and there was StationIO.</p><p>It&rsquo;s far from perfect, or even pretty (it&rsquo;s a mess, but I&rsquo;ll get things sorted out, in time), but it works.</p><p>And because I&rsquo;m (a tiny bit) lazy (did I tell you I was lazy ?), I created a <a href=https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/StationIO-Station>generator</a>, in HTML and javascript, for the code ^^. As I was already at it, there an installer script generator, as well ;)</p><p>It&rsquo;s another take on the whole IoT stuff. Stations are independant and instead of reporting to a gateway/hub/whatever each has an rest api so you can fetch ionformations from them.</p><p>I find it simpler than having to have an MQTT gateway and also more versatile/resilient as I can talk to each station directly from anywhere on the network.</p><p>This means, stations can talk to each other, any computer can talk to any stations, etc&mldr; in a more decentralized fashion, me likey.</p><p>Now, if you&rsquo;d rather have it working with MQTT, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s a few copy paste away (It&rsquo;s just arduino code, after all).</p></div></div></article></main></body></html>
