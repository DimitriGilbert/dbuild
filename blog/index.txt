7:T45f9,
_TLDR; Eric loop is a concept that upgrades Ralph loop by adding more complexity and depth to the idea of managing AI systems, [bash version of the article](/assets/blackhole/from_ralph_to_eric/bashticle.sh)_

I wont reintroduce the concept of Ralph loop, if you have been anywhere near AI in the first half of January 2026, you have heard of it ! If not, you should go and watch [Theo's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr9O6KFwbW4) (or someone else's but this is a good !)

You probably know which comics character Ralph is refering to, but Eric... who could it possibly be ?

If you thought short, fat and angry, you'd be right ! I'm of course talking about Eric Cartman from South Park !

While Ralph is naive and innocent, Eric is calculating and manipulative. Not something I'd look for in a Human, but for managing a bunch of AIs ? HELL YEAH !

![Eric saw Ralph](/images/blog/blackhole/from_ralph_to_eric/Eric_saw_Ralph.webp)

## The Eric Loop

An idea, even if good, always need some work and some back and forth to be implemented. So we first expose the idea to the AI to get an requirement document (PRD) and we work on it !

How ? you'll need to read first ! and straight away update parts you don't agree with or things you need to be more thorough !

Once that is done, ask AI models to ask You questions about the PRD and give all those, the PRD and your replies to another AI for update

Rince, Repeat, until you are satisfied with the document.

You can even get multiple model go at it to then compare and merge the outputs, using AI, of course :D

This is where we start diverging from the basic Ralph loop. instead of just passing that to the AI and hoping tasks will be implemented properly we get an AI to pre split and formalise the tasks and sub tasks into a list !

The rift grows further as we split the task implementation in several steps with:
* a planning phase that analyzes the requirements for the tasks, existing code, and conduct the needed research
* an execution phase to do the actual work,
* an optional automated verification phase (check types, build, tests, ...) with automated feedback to the execution phase in case of errors,
* an result review phase, that can send back to the execution phase for further refinement.

Once all that is done ? the Eric loop goes on for the next phase of the plan, just like Ralph !

## But, Why... ?

Separation of concerns !

Yes models have gotten smarter, but if you played around with sub agents and skills, you know that prompting is not dead (yet...)

Having a neat separation like that helps you have better prompts for each phase of the task execution.

As a side effect, it mmeans you can control which model is used for which phase maybe you dont need Opus the whole way if it made a banger plan !

## What would it look like ?

We are going to create a small project from an idea I have, you can do it to if you like !

It's called Tiny-till, a small app to have a simple till for itinerant merchants.

But we are going to need a tool to help us ... 

### Task-o-matic

Yep, I already kind of made said tool :D ! [task-o-matic](https://task-o-matic.dev)

I'll write more about it in a future post ! but you already have plenty of content to go through on the site itself.

I made sure to generate a lot of docs and a couple tutorials so you can already give it a try if you'd like !

But in a nutshell, it helps you create PRDs, refine them , split into tasks and subtasks and finally wiring all that to your favorite AI harness !

### Let's get this rolling

For the AI to operate properly, we need a specific stack, that way, we limit hallucination !

#### Initialisation and bootstrapping

Task-o-matic uses [better-t-stack](https://better-t-stack.dev) under the hood to bootstrap the stack so let's do that !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest init init --project-name tiny-till \
  --frontend tanstack-router \
  --backend none \
  --package-manager bun && cd tiny-till
```

Boom, a monorepo for Tiny-till ! Batteries included : tailwind, shadcn, build script and all :D

Why `init init` ? you might have missed the whole using AI to code whole projects, sometimes... it is not aesthetically pleasing, and you should learn not to care to much (is my take on that... or lazyness...)

You will need a .env file to configure the AI stack.

```ini
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter

AI_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk_123456azertPOIUY7890i58008
```

#### Document the requirements of your project

Now, we tell the AI what we want to do, but why would we limit ourselves to 1 ?

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd create \
  --ai-reasoning 4096 \
  --stream \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "mistralai/devstral-2512:free:free" \
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "minimax/minimax-m2.1;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "google/gemini-3-flash-preview;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  "i would like to build tiny-till,
  it will be a small web app, local first (for sparse internet connection) that serve as a very simple till for on the go seller, farmers markets stall, etc...
  the idea came from me watching my baker who does delivery tour twice a week. she is always fighting here calculator to make the tally and she gromle about it a lot
  the idea wwould be only a few screens : 
  - product management (add/remove product, name+price (img optional) ) : a list with action buttons, + or edit happen inline (+ at the top)
  - a tally page : grid of product for fast and easy access (row of 2 or 3 for mobile, 4 to 6 on tablet, normal/compact variant, control by setting)
    - clicking on a product adds it to the count
    - number of this product added appear in the card, click on it trigger an input field to enter value with a remove button
  - a setting page : theme, display, import/export catalog
  No saving, it is purely done too calculate the price and is not meant for accounting purposes
  i am using tanstack-router and the project is already set up with tailwind css typescript and shadcnUI"
```

Am I using free endpoints for "real" work ? Yes, yes I am ! Does it distort my views on how much AI work should cost ? ... Why would it ? No, no, you just being a killjoy right now !

#### Petrol is not the only thing that needs refining !

A few minutes later... I got myself this (`cat .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md`)[/assets/blackhole/from-ralph-to-eric/prd-master.md] it doesn't really need more questions, but let's see what Claude has to say, shall we ?

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd question  --stream \
  --file .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md \
  --ai-model anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet --ai-reasoning 1500
```

Well, let's answer those... some are pertinant ! I guess that's why we bring out the big guns !

Let's reply !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd refine  --stream\
  --file .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md \
  --ai-model anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet --ai-reasoning 1500 \
  --output .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master-refined.md \
  --questions prd-questions.json
```

Questions are asked interactivelly ;)

```markdown
"The PRD mentions using Zustand with persist middleware for the Catalog, but also specifies IndexedDB as the storage layer. Should Zustand's persist middleware be configured to use IndexedDB directly, or will there be a custom sync layer between Zustand and IndexedDB? This affects how image blobs are handled since Zustand persist middleware typically works best with serializable data."

yes, configure Zustand's persist middleware to use IndexedDB directly.
```

```markdown
"For the 'Tap Badge to manually enter quantity' feature, what should happen if a user enters invalid input (negative numbers, decimals, non-numeric characters, or zero)? Should zero be treated as 'remove from cart' or should it maintain the item with 0 quantity until explicitly removed?",

zero should be treated as 'remove from cart'.
```

```markdown
"The PRD states the tally is 'transient' and held in memory, yet also mentions using sessionStorage. Given that sessionStorage persists across page refreshes within the same tab, this conflicts with the 'privacy and simplicity' goal of resetting on refresh. Should the tally truly reset on refresh (pure memory), or should it survive accidental refreshes during a transaction (sessionStorage)?",

no persistance, this is not for accounting and should only be in memory, when a new tally starts, the previous one does not exist anymore.
```

```markdown
"With TanStack Router's file-based routing, how should the navigation structure be organized? Specifically, should the Tally Page be the root route ('/'), and if users are on the Settings or Catalog management page when they refresh, should they be automatically redirected back to the Tally Page to prevent data loss confusion?",

yes, / is the tally page, yes redirect to tally page.
```

```markdown
"The image upload feature is marked as 'optional' for products, but the PRD recommends 'no images for MVP' in the risk mitigation. Should image upload functionality be completely excluded from MVP (Phase 1-5), or should the data model and UI be built to accommodate images even if the upload feature is disabled/hidden initially?",

no, i want images, just inforce a strict size limitation, 128*128 px, this is not meant to be a full image gallery, just a thumbnail for display, future improvement maybe to try and resize/optimise bigger image directly on device...but not in MVP !
```

```markdown
"For the Import/Export catalog feature, what should happen when importing a JSON file that contains product IDs that conflict with existing products? Should it merge (overwrite matching IDs), append (create duplicates), or prompt the user to choose? Also, should the import validate the JSON schema and handle corrupt/invalid files gracefully?",

overwrite and yes, must validate.
```

```markdown
"The 'Compact vs Normal' view toggle affects card size, but how should this interact with the responsive column count? For example, if a tablet user sets 6 columns in Normal view, should switching to Compact view automatically increase columns (e.g., to 8) to utilize the space savings, or should column count remain fixed per the user's explicit setting?",

yes, auto increase, 'tis why we want compact !
```

```markdown
"Given the Turborepo setup mentioned in the stack, is this application intended to be part of a monorepo with potential future packages (e.g., a companion admin dashboard, analytics service)? If so, should the data models and storage utilities be architected in a shared package from the start, or is this truly a standalone application for now?"

no, single package for now, we'll see later for the rest. let's keep it simple for now.
```

Well, this little stunt just costed me a nice 15 cts, more or les 10x more than the first PRD generation...

I don't know what is the most amazing... that 

* 1 call costs more than the 10 previous, 
* I can complain about a 2 days worth of work document cost 15 cents for only a few seconds of work !
* a document worth 2 of my days of work costs 15 cents to produce...in only a few seconds...

I haven't decided yet...anywooooooo, time to move on and not get siderated !

#### Touching up and go

When i said seconds, i lied, I spent 5 minutes editing the file. to fix lib versions, marked install and config work as done, and, finally, set expectation for the design.

the last thing we have to do, is ask an AI to split into main tasks.

once again, i wont only do 1, but this time, I'll ask Claude to be the final task creator, from others input !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd parse  --ai-reasoning 4096 --stream \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096"\
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet;reasoning=4096"
```

And there goes another 8.2 cents burnt for the token Gods, but in return, we get a detailed breakdown of the tasks required to complete the project !

We still have to split those tasks though... To make them more palatable for the current crop of AI models ! 

You should really consider reviewing the tasks in detail before spliting, not vibe planning like a muppet ! (guess what I did ^^)

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest tasks split  --all --stream \
  --reasoning 4096 \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096"\
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet;reasoning=4096"
```

I think Claude is not necessary here, but I had me $3 of openrouter credit i have to burn before the end of the month soooooo... big guns it is !

Burnt a tenth of that ! but now... we are actually ready ! Almost...

#### AGENTS.md

Or CLAUDE, or GEMINI, depends on your harness of choice, For me, it is opencode i'am going to run the /init prompt in opencode !

```bash
opencode run "/init"
```

it is not mandatory, but it is a good way to prevent dumb mistake and set some proper behavior regarding a few things, for me, i'll add the following

* Not to run the dev server
* not start background/long running processes
* not to use `:any`, `as any` or `any` as type, I want a typesafe codebase
* before claiming success, `bun run check-types` and `bun run build` must both succeed
* to fix LSP error when they happen
* use shadcn component has much as possible
* stay DRY and prefer creating custom components and utilities than repeat code
* use adapted skills when possible (frontend-design skill is mandatory when working on the frontend)
* that it is a static app project that will be hosted on github pages
* to use Context7 MCP in case more documentation or up to date documentation is needed (as the knowledge is certainly behind because of cutoff training date)

```bash
opencode run "Add the following to the AGENTS.md, remove any conflicting instructions you created, these take precedence : 
* Not to run the dev server
* not start background/long running processes
* not to use `:any`, `as any` or `any` as type, I want a typesafe codebase
* before claiming success, `bun run check-types` and `bun run build` must both succeed
* to fix LSP error when they happen
* use shadcn component has much as possible
* stay DRY and prefer creating custom components and utilities than repeat code
* use adapted skills when possible (frontend-design skill is mandatory when working on the frontend)
* that it is a static app project that will be hosted on github pages
* to use Context7 MCP in case more documentation or up to date documentation is needed (as the knowledge is certainly behind because of cutoff training date)" -c
```

I might add more as the agent works if i see reccuring errors and dumb things happening

#### Time to let Eric loose...

Well, guys, stash your parents away cause we are going to let Eric go at it !

Because I am El CheapoDev DelBrokeCasa, i am going to use my GLM coding plan to code, that way, i wont break the bank and it is OK enough for something like that i think !

If you'd rather use claude code, use the `--tool claude` option. (or codex/gemini/kilo) but opencode is nicer as it stream the content out (in part at least) so you see what is happening !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest tasks execute-loop --include-prd \
  --plan --plan-model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --review --review-model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --validate "npm run check-types && npm run build"
```

And now, you wait, coffee, snacks, more coffee, diner and breakfast probably, it gonna take a while ^^

### What's the result

Half a day later, Eric has successfully completed the task. yaaay \o/

`npm run dev`, browser to http://localhost:3001 aaaaand, it does not work.... XD

I have a very fancy error page telling me about some kind of "exceeded depth error blablabla"... Zustand... i bloody fucking HATE Zustand !

I could have gone in, open the project, read some of the 35970 lines of... **35970 LINES OF CODE** ??? Naaah, dude, ain't no way i'm even thinking about that !

Of course, i asked GLM to fix this obviously terrible usage of Zustand, and I even have to spend another few minutes screaming about some redirection to the / issue... I still felt like a caveman though !

I mean, having to open a tool ? To do ... **work** ?? Like it's 2022 or something !

I haven't been testing anything yet, so i'm pretty sure there'll be a few more issues, but the dev server runs, i can navigate the app without error (even in console) so it is not bad at all !

I might do a follow up later on, to update you on what i had to do to get it a bit closer to the original idea (if needed ^^)

## What do you think ? Where do we go from here ?

So that's the end (of this article) ! What do you think ? did you try a similar technique ? What's the plan next, cause...

If you are interested, the repo can be found on [github](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/tiny-till). Is the code great ?

As for [task-o-matic](https://task-o-matic.dev), the [repo is on github](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic) so feel free to poke around ;)

What about the "Eric Loop", how can you do that yourself ? Well, the beautiful thing with AI is that, you can actually ask it to write code ! So a quick

```markdown
coudl you create a bash script to have a program that would run the "Eric Loop" with custom options ?

letting me specify the project, what model to use and when, I basically want everything configurable through options !

use the --help command of task-o-matic if you need any doc !
```

[this being the result](/assets/blackhole/from_ralph_to_eric/eric_loop.sh), your own Eric Loop, ain't life beautiful ?

Hope you enjoyed, I'll see you around
8:T4c72,
Je vais pas re-introduire le concept de Ralph loop, si vous avez été a côté de l'IA dans la première moitié de janvier 2026, vous en avez entendu parler ! Si non, vous devriez aller voir la vidéo de [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr9O6KFwbW4) (ou quelqu'un d'autre mais celle-la est bonne !)

Vous savez probablement quel personnage de comics Ralph référence, mais Eric... ca pourrait être qui ?

Si vous avez pensé petit, gros et en colère, vous avez raison ! Je parle bien sûr d'Eric Cartman de South Park !

Alors que Ralph est naïf et innocent, Eric est calculateur et manipulateur. Pas quelque chose que je chercherais chez une personne, mais pour gérer un tas d'IA ? Carrément !

![Eric saw Ralph](/images/blog/blackhole/from_ralph_to_eric/Eric_saw_Ralph.webp)

## La boucle Eric

Comme chaque projet ca commence par une idée, 

Et même si elle est bonne, on a toujours besoin de la retravailler, de faire des ajustements, ... pour bien implémentée.

Donc on expose d'abord l'idée à l'IA pour avoir un Product Requirements Document (PRD) et on travaille dessus !

Comment ca, lire ? Et bhe oui, il faut d'abord lire ! et tout de suite mettre à jour les parties avec lesquelles vous n'êtes pas d'accord ou les choses qui doivent être plus approfondies !

Une fois que c'est fait, demandez aux modèles d'IA de vous poser des questions sur le PRD et donnez tout ça, le PRD et vos réponses, à une autre IA pour la mise à jour.

Rincez, Répétez, jusqu'à ce que vous soyez satisfait du document.

Vous pouvez même faire traiter le PRD par plusieurs modèles pour ensuite comparer et fusionner les résultats, en utilisant l'IA, bien sûr :D

C'est là qu'on commence à diverger de la boucle Ralph de base. Au lieu de juste passer ça à l'IA et espérer que les tâches seront bien implémentées, on fait pré-découper et formaliser les tâches et sous-tâches en une liste par une IA !

L'écart grandit encore plus car on sépare l'implémentation des tâches en plusieurs étapes avec :
* une phase de planification qui analyse les requis pour les tâches, le code existant, et fait les recherches nécessaires
* une phase d'exécution pour faire le travail réel
* une phase optionnelle de vérification automatisée (check types, build, tests, ...) avec feedback automatique vers la phase d'exécution en cas d'erreurs
* une phase de review des résultats, qui peut renvoyer vers la phase d'exécution pour plus de raffinement.

Une fois tout ça fait ? la boucle Eric continue pour la phase suivante du plan, tout comme Ralph !

## Mais, Pourquoi... ?

La séparation des préoccupations !

Oui les modèles sont devenus plus intelligents, mais si vous avez joué avec des sub-agents et des skills, vous savez que le prompting n'est pas mort (pour le moment...)

Avoir une séparation propre comme ça aide à avoir de meilleurs prompts pour chaque phase de l'exécution des tâches.

Comme effet secondaire, ça signifie que vous pouvez contrôler quel modèle est utilisé pour quelle phase, peut-être que vous n'avez pas besoin d'Opus tout le long si "il" a fait un super plan !

## A quoi ça ressemblerait ?

On va créer un petit projet à partir d'une idée que j'ai, vous pouvez le faire aussi si vous voulez !

Il s'appelle Tiny-till, une petite app pour avoir une caisse simple pour marchands ambulants.

Mais on va avoir besoin d'un outil pour nous aider ...

### Task-o-matic

Ouais, j'ai déjà fait l'outil en question :D ! [task-o-matic](https://task-o-matic.dev)

J'écrirai plus à ce sujet dans un futur post ! mais vous avez déjà pas mal de contenu à parcourir sur le site lui-même.

J'ai fait gaffe à générer plein de docs et quelques tutoriels pour que vous puissiez déjà essayer si vous voulez !

Mais en gros, ça aide à créer des PRDs, les raffiner, découper en tâches et sous-tâches et finalement connecter tout ça à votre outil de code assité d'IA préféré !

### Allons-y

Pour que l'IA opère proprement, on a besoin d'une stack spécifique, comme ça, on limite les hallucinations !

#### Initialisation et bootstrap

Task-o-matic utilise [better-t-stack](https://better-t-stack.dev) en interne pour bootstrap la stack donc faisons ça !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest init init --project-name tiny-till \
  --frontend tanstack-router \
  --backend none \
  --package-manager bun && cd tiny-till
```

Boum, un monorepo pour Tiny-till ! Batteries incluses : tailwind, shadcn, script de build et tout :D

Pourquoi `init init` ? vous avez peut-être raté toute l'histoire de l'IA qui code des projets entiers, parfois... c'est pas esthétique, et vous devriez apprendre à pas trop y faire attention (c'est mon avis la-dessus... ou de la flemme...)

Vous aurez besoin d'un fichier .env pour configurer la stack IA.

```ini
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter

AI_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk_123456azertPOIUY7890i58008
```

#### Documenter les requis de votre projet

Maintenant, on dit à l'IA ce qu'on veut faire, mais pourquoi se limiter à 1 ?

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd create \
  --ai-reasoning 4096 \
  --stream \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "mistralai/devstral-2512:free:free" \
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "minimax/minimax-m2.1;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "google/gemini-3-flash-preview;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  "i would like to build tiny-till,
  it will be a small web app, local first (for sparse internet connection) that serve as a very simple till for on the go seller, farmers markets stall, etc...
  the idea came from me watching my baker who does delivery tour twice a week. she is always fighting here calculator to make the tally and she gromle about it a lot

  - a setting page : theme, display, import/export catalog
  No saving, it is purely done too calculate the price and is not meant for accounting purposes
  i am using tanstack-router and the project is already set up with tailwind css typescript and shadcnUI"
```

J'utilise des endpoints gratuits pour du "vrai" travail ? Oui, oui, je fais ! Est-ce que ça fausse ma vision de combien le travail IA devrait coûter ? ... pourquoi ça ferait ça ? Non, non, vous êtes juste en train de gâcher la fête là !

#### L'essence n'est pas la seule chose qui doit être raffinée !

Quelques minutes plus tard... je me suis récupéré ça (`cat .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md`)[/assets/blackhole/from-ralph-to-eric/prd-master.md] ça a pas vraiment besoin de plus de questions, mais voyons ce que Claude a a dire, d'accord ?

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd question  --stream \
  --file .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md \
  --ai-model anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet --ai-reasoning 1500
```

Bon, répondons à ça... certaines sont pertinentes ! je suppose que c'est pour ça qu'on sort les gros canons !

Répondons !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd refine  --stream\
  --file .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md \
  --ai-model anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet --ai-reasoning 1500 \
  --output .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master-refined.md \
  --questions prd-questions.json
```

Les questions sont posées interactivement ;)

```markdown

oui, / est la page tally, oui rediriger vers la page tally.

"The image upload feature is marked as 'optional' for products, but the PRD recommends 'no images for MVP' in the risk mitigation. Should image upload functionality be completely excluded from MVP (Phase 1-5), or should the data model and UI be built to accommodate images even if the upload feature is disabled/hidden initially?",

non, je veux les images, imposez juste une limitation de taille stricte, 128*128 px, c'est pas fait pour être une galerie d'images complète, juste une miniature pour l'affichage, amélioration future peut-être pour essayer de redimensionner/optimiser des images plus grosses directement sur l'appareil...mais pas en MVP !

"For the Import/Export catalog feature, what should happen when importing a JSON file that contains product IDs that conflict with existing products? Should it merge (overwrite matching IDs), append (create duplicates), or prompt the user to choose? Also, should the import validate the JSON schema and handle corrupt/invalid files gracefully?",

écraser et oui, doit valider.

"The 'Compact vs Normal' view toggle affects card size, but how should this interact with the responsive column count? For example, if a tablet user sets 6 columns in Normal view, should switching to Compact view automatically increase columns (e.g., to 8) to utilize the space savings, or should column count remain fixed per the user's explicit setting?",

oui, augmentation auto, c'est pour ça qu'on veut compact !

"Given the Turborepo setup mentioned in the stack, is this application intended to be part of a monorepo with potential future packages (e.g., a companion admin dashboard, analytics service)?

non, package unique pour l'instant, on verra après pour le reste. gardons ça simple pour l'instant.
```

Bon, cette petite astuce vient de me coûter un joli 15 cts, plus ou moins 10x plus que la première génération de PRD...

Je sais pas ce qui est le plus incroyable... que

* 1 appel coûte plus que les 10 précédents,
* je puisse me plaindre qu'un document de 2 jours de travail coûte 15 cents pour seulement quelques secondes de travail !
* un document qui vaut 2 de mes jours de travail coûte 15 cents à produire...en seulement quelques secondes...

J'ai pas encore décidé...bon bref, passons à la suite et restons pas bloqués !

#### Les petites retouches et c'est parti

Quand j'ai dit secondes, j'ai menti, j'ai passé 5 minutes à éditer le fichier. pour fixer les versions de lib, marquer le travail d'install et de config comme fait, et, enfin, définir les attentes pour le design.

la dernière chose qu'on a a faire, c'est demander à une IA de découper en tâches principales.

encore une fois, je vais pas en faire qu'une seule, mais cette fois, je vais demander à Claude d'être le créateur de tâches final, à partir des entrées des autres !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd parse  --ai-reasoning 4096 --stream \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096"\
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet;reasoning=4096"
```

Et voila encore 8.2 cents brûlés en offrandes aux dieux du token, mais en retour, on a un découpage détaillé des tâches requises pour finir le projet !

On a encore à découper ces tâches par contre... Pour les rendre plus digérables, même pour les meilleurs modèles IA à l'heure actuelle !

Ca serait une bonne idée de revoir les tâches en détail avant de les découper, pas faire du vibe-planning comme un neuneu ! (devinez ce que j'ai fait ^^)

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest tasks split  --all --stream \
  --reasoning 4096 \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096"\
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet;reasoning=4096"
```

Je pense pas que Claude soit nécessaire là, mais j'avais mes $3 de crédit openrouter à brûler avant la fin du mois donc bon... on sort l'artillerie lourde !

Et bim, 30 centimes de plus ! mais maintenant... on est vraiment prêts ! Presque...

#### AGENTS.md

Ou CLAUDE, ou GEMINI, dépend de votre outil de code assité préféré, Pour moi, c'est opencode je vais lancer le prompt /init dans opencode !

```bash
opencode run "/init"
```

c'est pas vraiment obligatoire, mais c'est quand meme une bonne histoire d'eviter les plus grosse conneries et de recentrer quelques comportements pour certaines choses, du coup, on rajoute ca :

* Pas lancer le server de dev
* pas démarrer de processus en arrière-plan/de longue durée
* pas utiliser `:any`, `as any` ou `any` comme type, je veux une base de code typesafe
* avant de dire "Jai finiiiii", `bun run check-types` et `bun run build` doivent tous les deux réussir
* corriger les erreurs LSP quand elles arrivent
* utiliser les composants shadcn autant que possible
* rester DRY et préférer créer des composants personnalisés et des utilitaires que répéter du code
* utiliser les compétences adaptées quand c'est possible (la compétence frontend-design est obligatoire quand on travaille sur le frontend)
* que c'est un projet d'app statique qui sera hébergé sur github pages
* utiliser Context7 MCP au cas où plus de documentation ou une documentation à jour est nécessaire (car la connaissance est certainement en retard à cause de la date limite de training)

```bash
opencode run "Add the following to the AGENTS.md, remove any conflicting instructions you created, these take precedence :
* Not to run the dev server
* not start background/long running processes
* not to use `:any`, `as any` or `any` as type, I want a typesafe codebase
* before claiming success, `bun run check-types` and `bun run build` must both succeed
* to fix LSP error when they happen
* use shadcn component has much as possible
* stay DRY and prefer creating custom components and utilities than repeat code
* use adapted skills when possible (frontend-design skill is mandatory when working on the frontend)
* that it is a static app project that will be hosted on github pages
* to use Context7 MCP in case more documentation or up to date documentation is needed (as the knowledge is certainly behind because of cutoff training date)" -c
```

J'ajouterai peut-être plus pendant que l'agent travaille si je vois des erreurs récurrentes et des gourdineries qui arrivent trop souvent (... si je regarde passer le train... c'est pas dit XD)

#### Et maintenant, on fait rouler Eric...

Bon les gars, cachez vos parents car on va laisser Eric y aller !

Parce que je suis El CheapoDev DelBrokeCasa, je vais utiliser mon GLM coding plan pour coder, comme ça, je vais pas eclater ma tirelire et c'est assez intelligent pour un truc comme ça je pense !

Si vous préférez claude code, utilisez l'option `--tool claude`. (ou codex/gemini/kilo) mais opencode est plus sympa car il stream le contenu (en partie en tout cas) donc vous voyez ce qui se passe (meuuuuh !) !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest tasks execute-loop --include-prd \
  --plan --plan-model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --review --review-model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --validate "npm run check-types && npm run build"
```

Et maintenant, vous attendez, un café, un gouter, un peu plus de café, le dîner et pis le p'tit déj probablement, ça va prendre un moment ^^

### Résultat

Une demi-journée plus tard, Eric a terminé la tâche avec succès. youhou \o/

`npm run dev`, navigateur vers http://localhost:3001 et eeeet, ça marche pas.... XD

J'ai une super page d'erreur qui me parle d'une sorte de "exceeded depth error blablabla"... Zustand... je déteste PUTAIN Zustand !

J'aurais pu aller ouvrir le projet, lire quelques-unes des 35970 lignes de... **35970 LIGNES DE CODE** ??? Naaah, gros, c'est mort de chez mort !

Bien sûr, j'ai demandé à GLM de corriger l'utilisation degueulasse de Zustand, et j'ai même dû passer quelques minutes à hurler sur un problème de redirection vers /... J'avais l'impression d'être un homme des cavernes quand même !

Je veux dire, devoir ouvrir un outil ? Pour faire... **du travail** ?? Nan mais Allo quoi, c'est 2022 ou quoi ?

J'ai rien testé encore, donc je suis à peu près sûr qu'il y aura quelques autres problèmes, mais le serveur de dev tourne, je peux naviguer dans l'app sans erreur (même en console) donc c'est pas mal du tout !

Je ferai peut-être un autre article plus tard, pour vous tenir au courant de ce que j'ai eu à faire pour rapprocher un peu plus de l'idée originale (si nécessaire ^^)

## Vous en pensez quoi ? On va où après ?

Donc c'est la fin (de cet article) ! Vous en pensez quoi ? vous avez essayé une technique similaire ? C'est quoi le plan après, parce que bon...

Si vous êtes intéressés, le repo peut être trouvé sur [github](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/tiny-till). Le code est génial ?

Et pour [task-o-matic](https://task-o-matic.dev), le [repo est sur github](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic) donc n'hésitez pas à faire un tour ;)

Et pour la "Boucle Eric", comment faire vous-même ? Yaka demander à l'IA :D vous pouvez lui demander d'écrire du code ! Donc un petit

```markdown
tu pourrais créer un script bash qui exécuterait la "Boucle Eric" avec des options personnalisées ?

en me laissant spécifier le projet, quel modèle utiliser et quand, je veux tout pouvoir configurer via des options !

utilise la commande --help de task-o-matic si t'as besoin de doc !
```

[voici le résultat](/assets/blackhole/from_ralph_to_eric/eric_loop.sh), votre Eric Loop a vous, elle est pas belle la vie ?!

Hope you enjoyed, I'll see you around
9:T2f74,
## Why ?

I looked for something like that and did not find any, so I am building one !

I will take this opportunity to build it in public, as much as possible ! Meaning most prompts and conversations will be available for you to read and "inspire" yourself !

Why not all conversations ? Well, sometimes, I forget, other times... I'm swearing way too much so it does not bring any value ! (I am grumpy and irritable as a default state, pain makes it worst... at the moment, the pain level oscillate between 2 and 5 out of 10 ^^)

I also want to show others that you can actually create something with AI doing most of the grunt work of dev with "careful" orchestration.

Is it going to be perfect ? XD what a stupid question ! NO ! 'f course not !

Can it get the job done ? I certainly hope so !

## What is it already ?

It is a library/marketplace of Shadcn ui components ! I was tired of hunting for cool components and blocks all around the internet !

Between github lackluster SEO and worst devs' website's one, it is really hard to come across new components, and it is a shame cause some are fantastic !

Also, as a creator of some component (with awful terrible SEOed sites...) i kind of feel unseen, sooo [cn-registry.dev](https://cn-registry.dev) was born !

## The process

Like I said, this is a build in public thing, so I am going to try and share what I learned with you (and my future self if this MF wants to listen !).

How I did things, what worked, what did not really do so, my fuck ups, hope and delusions...

In a sense, I am going to make mistake and look like a fool so you don't have to !

Let's start at the beginning...

### The Idea

Plenty of time I see people asking for ideas on things to build, to other humans, or worse, AI...

No... please don't ! not here !

I sincerely thing ideating is **The** thing that will separate us from machines for awhile still ! You should not delegate that !

"But how do I find ideas then ?" might you witty reader ask me ! And so rightful would you be !

So let me answer you with a question, that could trigger some ideation !

Are there no problem that need solving, in the place that you live in ?

Poetic rhymes aside, solve one of your damn fking problem man (or girl, you are welcome to do so too !) !

That way, even if you don't end up having clients, you'll have solved one of your problem !

For me the problem was "lazy ass dev want find shadcn components easy" ! There you go, how do you solve that problem ?!

### Initial plan

Nothing ground breaking or revolutionary, a dumb directory would do the trick... but that would lack a bit of flair... wouldn't it ?

Solving a simple problem does not necessarily mean a simplistic solution and I was already very keen on over-engineering my own tombstone sooo, let's go for that !

Why not sprinkle some social stuff on it ? It's not because I am limited regarding those skills that others are !

User account, likes, comments ! there you go ! Now we can socialise !

We have the basic Idea of what we want ? Yeah ?

Yeah ! Now we can go bother some AI with it !

### Start proompting

```
I want to build a website using nextjs 15 and shadcn  (i got the stack figured out !) and I need a complete plan to create the front end !
the project is called "cn-registry" and it will be a registry of shadcn components and tools, because hunting for them feels like a full time job.
I want you to plan the needed components and pages, I aim for maximum reusability so if something make sense standalone, it should be ! i do not want you to create code, just the plan !
I want a home page with carousels, one with the 10 latest components, one with the trending one
components will have a name, a description, a repo link, a website, an installation url, categories and each should have a dedicated page with the copiable install command, the repo readme and github info, some showcase with code toggles
Tools will be the same but the install url might be for an npm package or not exists
I want a search page with card or list results and filters on categories
same for tools but on a different page
I want to have a star rating system and user account where user can see the components they stared
User will be able to comment on components
```

As you can see, simple, (in)efficient, (de)organized ! And a couple refinement later, I have my intermediary prompt for V0 !

I wont bore you with the mile long prompt (you have convo link in repo ^^) but it was a good mile long and i did not change much !

Suffice to say that after that I had some "mock data stuffed" frontend prototype for... where am I going to put that... ?!!

### Select your stack

I already did, and you probably should think of that before proompting to be honest ! For me it was easy, I just reached for my current default stack Nextjs front and back, trpc, tailwind and shadcn.

Yes, it is boring. Yes, everyone is doing the same. I don't care.

I start a gazillion projects (and a half) every month cause I am unable to focus on one thing at a time, it doesn't mean I have the cognitive bandwidth to try and learn new stuff every times !

There is also plenty of good docs and resources for all these, which make it easy to work with without too much prior experience

Plus, as a massive, Massive (MASSIVE !) bonus : It works well with AI ! (mostly, sometimes)

Am I saying you should pick this stack ? If you like it, yes, otherwise, i couldn't care less !

Pick what you know, the new hyped stuff or what tickles your fancy ! Really, I couldn't care less, but I care for you to do it right ! Use [better-t-stack](https://better-t-stack.dev) !

yes, this is authoritative, but if your stack is in, use it ! 1 command, boom, project scaffolded and ready to go in seconds (thank me later)

### Let the music start !

```markdown
[x] Idea
[x] Concept
[x] project initialized
[x] frontend prototype
[ ] proper plan
```

Ooooh ? You thought... ? you thought I was going to open my favourite AI agent and start vibing away ?

no no no ! This is not the way ! You are going to go back to your first AI pal you used for the front end prototype plan and you are going to ask it for another plan !

```markdown
I am using the latest version of drizzle orm and postgres so i would like you to carefully plan the whole complete data model I will need,
including user setting and admin/creator utilities table tha migth be needed in the project. we will iterate to align with my goal but try to makee it very comphrehensive
```

It did a pretty good job with my previous frontend plan alignement in one shot soooo...

```
cd workspace/Code/cn-registry;
claude
"I want you to implement the server complete side of the project following this :
  **cn-registry Complete Data Model Plan**
...
  better auth is already setup and running,
  I want schema definition and trpc routes with complete access management for security.
  make sure the apps build when you are done with the backend.
"
```

Et en voiture Simone !

Realignment aside, this got me a building backend that I asked the agent to wire up to the frontend.

### Broken string and other misadventures...

Were you waiting for it ? To be completely honest, I did not think it was going to be so early...but yes, no plan survive contacts with the enemy.

Which enemy ? Trpc ! No no ! not trpc trpc, trpc version and the fact that a major revision came out between the training cut off date and the release/adoption of trpc version...

What does this mean ? AI follows patterns it "knows", guess what it does when it doesn't know the patterns ?

Yup, it's "hallucination time" baby ! Wooooooot Wooooooot ! -\_- Can you feel the pain ? ok, good.

But for a villain in the story, a Hero will come forward, you see

A hero to help the dragons slay, and its name is LLM dot txt

```markdown
my stack is using the following package.json files
Agents often fails on trpc usage because their knowledge is out of date.
I would like you to fetch the lates trpc docs and prepare a comprhensive but concise llm.txt for my agents to work with.
it is only destined towards LLM so you can forgo absolutely all the fluff and present information in the best possible way for you to ingest it efficiently
```

I fed the responded file to my agent, and behold, a few prompts later, I was served dragons' heart for dinner !

### more, More, MOOOOAR

Do you feel the power rising ? The exhileration of AI acceleration ? Is your brain broken and addicted yet ?

Nooo ? well, we are going to have to work on that ! Maybe it's because we lack documentation ?

You are very right ! So I asked gemini cli to do that !

Unfortunatly, i do not have this prompt anymore, but it went something like :

```
I am working on this project [description]
the front and backend are prototyped, the apps build but i did not test anything yet.
I would like you to analyze it very (very ! VERY !!) carefully !
you have to open many files to make sure you understand the app and how it is built.
once done, please create some documentation about that.
```

to which I invariably had to complement after the first response (exact paraphrasing)

```
oooOOOOH FFS ! HOW THE F DO YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING, YOU OPENED 5 FILES, 2 OF THEM WERE PACKAGE.JSON ! OPEN ALL THE FILES ! **ALL OF THEM**
```

Seriously, how does anyone work with gemini these days ? It ended up giving me some decent documentation after that flogging though !

What ? Why do I make the model document the thing already ?

```
Good. now that you have a complete understanding of the full project, i want you to create a plan to finish the implementation of the existing base.
then, I want you to create a plan in better.md that outlines possible enhancement to the base application.
One I want is a cart system so a user can add component to it and get a complete install command for all the components he selected.
be creative and come up with functionalities that would make this platform stand out
```

There you go, this is why ! now that you have something more than a couple of sentence, agents can stretch their legs !

What do similar enough architectures and software have as functionalities ? It will know ! You'll be left with the cherry picking and it might even give you more ideas !

### Tidy up and go forward

Armed with gemini's assertion of the codebase, I asked claude to do the work (you would have to pay me to allow gemini modifying my files !)

Once complete I asked it to create a proper plan for the extra functionalities I chose

- cart system
- project system
- github integration
- creator profiles

It gracefully did that while I started testing the app. Systematic clicking and typing, going from error to error, indexing them by small groups, asking my agent to take care of them.

This is the perfect occasion to start having a look at the code... yes, just now.

To be fair, I was probably less than 3 hours in and I also come from a time where bootstrapping an app was probably that long sooooo... not saying this is good, but I have done that a dozen times already and I know what to expect.

Bug hunting took an hour or so, nothing major, missing "use client", dumb state management, over complicated logic, a bunch of alerts and prompts, in short, claude's specials (I was spared me the blueish purple gradient this time though...)

Implementing the improvement plan was business as usual and took around another 3-4 hours

```
in @improvements.md implement phase/part ...
```

### One day at a time

I realize this is getting long, and, well it is the end of day 1 so I am going to stop here for now !

At that moment I had a mostly working app, with an admin side i could get in, component and tools could be added.

And as my eyes were all closing, I could not see shadows brewing

Covering me with joy and warm for my app worked like a charm

An innocent small idea that would become ...[find me a noun of something bad finishing by the sound a, i need a rhyme]

In the mean time, here is the [demo](https://cn-registry.dev) and the [repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/cn-registry), feedback greatly appreciated as always !
a:T3674,
## Pourquoi ?

J'ai cherché un truc comme ça et j'ai rien trouvé, alors je le construis !

Je vais en profiter pour le construire en public, autant que faire se peut ! Ca veuut dire que la plupart des prompts et des conversations seront disponibles pour les lire et s'en inspirer !

Pourquoi pas toutes les conversations ? Euuuh alors... bon... parfois, j'oublie. Eeeet euuuh d'autres fois... disons que c'est pas tellement family friendly ^^ ! (Je suis grincheux et irritable par défaut, quand j'ai mal, c'est pire... en ce moment, ca oscille entre 2 et 5 sur 10 ^^)

Je veux aussi montrer/prouver a d'autres qu'il est possible d'utiliser l'IA pour generer la majorité du code avec une "orchestration" minutieuse.

Est-ce que ce sera parfait ? XD quelle question stupide ! NON ! Bien sûr que non !

Est-ce que ça va faire le travail ? J'espère bien !

## Qu'est-ce que c'est déjà ?

C'est une bibliothèque/un marketplace de composants Shadcn ! J'en avais marre de chercher des composants et des blocs sympas un peu partout sur Internet !

Entre la SEO médiocre de GitHub et celle encore pires des sites de développeurs, c'est vraiment pas facile de tomber sur de nouveaux composants, et c'est dommage car certains sont fantastiques !

En plus, en tant que créateur de composants (avec des sites... dont le SEO est affreux...), je me sens un peu invisible, alors [cn-registry.dev](https://cn-registry.dev) est né !

## Le processus

Comme je l'ai dit, il s'agit d'une build in public, alors je vais partager avec vous ce que j'apprends (et mon futur moi si ce con se met a ecouter !).

Comment j'ai fait, ce qui a fonctionné, ou pas, mes conneries, mes espoirs et mes illusions...

En gros, je vais faire des erreurs et avoir l'air d'un idiot pour que vous n'ayez pas à le faire !

Commençons par le début...

### L'idée

C'est souventque je vois des gens demander des idées sur quoi construire, à d'autres, ou pire, à l'IA...

Non... s'il vous plaît, pas ici !

En vrai, l'idéation (oh je vais pas traduire un mot qu'existe pas non plus !) est **la** chose qui nous resteras face machines pour encore un moment ! Faut pas déléguer ca !

"Mais comment trouver des idées alors ?" pourrait me demander mon lecteur astucieux ! Et vous auriez tout à fait raison de le faire !

Alors laissez-moi vous répondre par une question qui pourrait déclencher un peu d'idéation !

Y a-t-il des problèmes à résoudre, là où vous vivez ?

_les 3 phrases d'avant marche tellement pas en francais, mais je les laisse tellement la traduction est moisie x-)_

Traduction en carton à part, résous un de **tes** problèmes mec (ou meuf, z'êtes également les bienvenus !) !

Comme ca, même si personne s'en sert, t'auras résolu un de tes problèmes !

Pour moi, le problème était "dev faignasse chereche composant shadcn facilement" ! Et voila, maintaint, comment on s'occupe de ca ?!

### Plan initial

Rien de révolutionnaire ou de génial, un bete annuaire ferait l'affaire... mais ca manque un peu de pepse... non ?

Problème simple ne signifie pas nécessairement solution simpliste et j'aime deja bien les usines a gaz alors, allons-y !

Pourquoi ne pas ajouter un peu de social ? C'est pas parce que je suis incompétent (ca marche aussi en 2 mots) sociales que les autres le sont !

Comptes utilisateurs, likes, commentaires ! Et hop, maintenant on socialise !

Bon, on a l'idée de base en entier ? Oui ?

Oui ! Et bhe y'a plus qu'a aller embêter une IA avec ça !

### A vos marques, pret, proomptez !

Oui, les prompts sont encores en anglais, ca marche mieux. vraiment !

```
I want to build a website using nextjs 15 and shadcn  (i got the stack figured out !) and I need a complete plan to create the front end !
the project is called "cn-registry" and it will be a registry of shadcn components and tools, because hunting for them feels like a full time job.
I want you to plan the needed components and pages, I aim for maximum reusability so if something make sense standalone, it should be ! i do not want you to create code, just the plan !
I want a home page with carousels, one with the 10 latest components, one with the trending one
components will have a name, a description, a repo link, a website, an installation url, categories and each should have a dedicated page with the copiable install command, the repo readme and github info, some showcase with code toggles
Tools will be the same but the install url might be for an npm package or not exists
I want a search page with card or list results and filters on categories
same for tools but on a different page
I want to have a star rating system and user account where user can see the components they stared
User will be able to comment on components
```

Commeon peut le voir, simple, (in)efficace, (dés)organisé ! Et quelques raffinements plus tard, j'ai mon prompt intermédiaire pour V0 !

Je ne vais pas vous ennuyer avec le prompt interminable (vous avez le lien de conversation dans le repo ^^), mais il était interminable et j'ai pas beaucoup changé de choses !

Apres le passage chez V0, j'avais un prototype de front-end avec des données simulées pour... Mais je vais le mettre où ça moi... ?!

### Sélectionnez votre stack

Perso, je l'ai déjà fait, et vous devriez probablement y penser avant de prompt en vrai ! Pour moi, c'était facile, j'ai pris ma stack par défaut du moment : Nextjs front et back, trpc, tailwind et shadcn.

Oui, c'est ennuyeux. Oui, tout le monde fait la même chose. Je m'en tape le coquillard !

Je commence un milliard de projets (et demi) chaque mois parce que je suis incapable de me concentrer sur une seule chose à la fois, ca veut pas dire que j'ai la de bande pasaante pour apprendre de nouvelles choses à chaque fois !

Il y a aussi pas mal de bonnes docs et ressources pour toutes ces technos, ca facilite le travail meme sans trop d'expérience préalable.

Et pour rien gacher, un gros, Gros (mais genre GROS) bonus : Cela fonctionne bien avec l'IA ! (enfin, des fois, un peu)

Est-ce que je dis que vous devriez choisir cette stack ? Si vous l'aimez, oui, sinon, je m'en fiche complètement !

Choisissez ce que vous connaissez, la nouvelle stack à la mode ou ce qui vous titille ! Vraiment, je m'en fiche complètement, mais je me soucie que vous le fassiez correctement ! Utilisez [better-t-stack](https://better-t-stack.dev) !

Oui, c'est autoritaire, mais si votre stack est dedans, utilisez ca ! 1 commande, boom, projet tout chaud et prêt à decoller en quelques secondes (remercie moi plus tard)

### Laissez la musique commencer !

```markdown
[x] Idée
[x] Concept
[x] projet initialisé
[x] prototype frontend
[ ] plan approprié
```

Ooooh ? Vous pensiez... ? vous pensiez que j'allais ouvrir mon agent IA préféré et commencer à vibe coder ?

uuuhh non non non ! pas la, pas encore ! la, on retourne à notre premier pote qu'on a utilisé pour le plan du front-end et on va lui demander un autre plan !

```markdown
I am using the latest version of drizzle orm and postgres so i would like you to carefully plan the whole complete data model I will need,
including user setting and admin/creator utilities table tha migth be needed in the project. we will iterate to align with my goal but try to makee it very comphrehensive
```

Comme j'ai deja reorientez les choses pour le front end, j'ai eu le droit a un joli plan en one shot, donc...

```
cd workspace/Code/cn-registry;
claude
"I want you to implement the server complete side of the project following this :
  **cn-registry Complete Data Model Plan**
...
  better auth is already setup and running,
  I want schema definition and trpc routes with complete access management for security.
  make sure the apps build when you are done with the backend.
"
```

Et en voiture Simone !

Mis à part les petites reorientations, ca m'a donné un backend "fonctionnel" (a une vache pres !) donc j'ai demandé à l'agent de connecter ca au frontend.

### C'est Bestel, il a mis la cassette et puis pouf !

Vous l'attendiez ? Pour être tout à fait honnête, je ne pensais pas que ce serait si tôt... mais oui, aucun plan ne survit au contact de l'ennemi.

Quel ennemi ? Trpc ! Non non ! pas trpc trpc (c'est très bien trpc !), la version de trpc et le fait qu'une révision majeure est sortie entre la date de coupure d'entrainement de claude et maintenant......

Qu'est ce que donc que ca pourrait il vouloir bien dire toussa ? Les LLMs suivent des schémas qu'elles "connaissent", et devinez ce qu'elles font quand elles connaîssentt pas les schémas ?

Ouep, c'est ca, elles "hallucinent" leurs mamies ! Wooooooot Wooooooot ! -\_- J'espere que vous sentez la douleur !

Mais pour un méchant dans l'histoire, un Héros se présentera un beau soir

Un héros pour aider les dragons à être tués, et son nom est LLM point txt

_eeeett vous savez a quoi on reconnaît des bonnes ryhmes ? elles se traduisent toutes seules!_

```markdown
my stack is using the following package.json files
Agents often fails on trpc usage because their knowledge is out of date.
I would like you to fetch the lates trpc docs and prepare a comprhensive but concise llm.txt for my agents to work with.
it is only destined towards LLM so you can forgo absolutely all the fluff and present information in the best possible way for you to ingest it efficiently
```

J'ai gavé la réponse à mon agent, et après quelques prompts, on m'a servi le cœur du dragon pour le dîner !

### encore, Encore, ENCOOORE

Vous sentez la puissance monter ? L'exaltation de l'accélération par l'IA ? Votre cerveau est-il déjà accro ? Non ? Eh bhe on va devoir travailler là-dessus !

Manque de la doc peut etre ?

Mais tout a fait tout a fait, allons voir ce bon vieux gemini !

je n'ai plus ce prompt, mais c'était quelque chose comme :

```
I am working on this project [description]
the front and backend are prototyped, the apps build but i did not test anything yet.
I would like you to analyze it very (very ! VERY !!) carefully !
you have to open many files to make sure you understand the app and how it is built.
once done, please create some documentation about that.
```

que j'ai invariablement dû compléter après la première réponse par un joyeux (paraphrase exacte)

```
oooOOOOH FFS ! HOW THE F DO YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING, YOU OPENED 5 FILES, 2 OF THEM WERE PACKAGE.JSON ! OPEN ALL THE FILES ! **ALL OF THEM**
```

Sérieusement, qui arrive a bosser avec gemini (vrais question !) ? Bon apres cette petite sceance de fouettage gemini m'as finalement pondus une doc correct !

De quoi, quoi ? Pourquoi j'ai fait documenter le taf par l'IA ?

```
Good. now that you have a complete understanding of the full project, i want you to create a plan to finish the implementation of the existing base.
then, I want you to create a plan in better.md that outlines possible enhancement to the base application.
One I want is a cart system so a user can add component to it and get a complete install command for all the components he selected.
be creative and come up with functionalities that would make this platform stand out
```

Voilà pourquoi ! Pour bien bosser les LLM ont besoin de plus de 2 phrases de contexte, avec une vision plus précise du code, l'IA pourra planifier plus efficacement !

Quelles fonctionnalités et architectures sont utilisé dans des logiciels similaires ? Il le saura ! Z'aurez plus qu'as faire vos emplettes et ca pourras meme debloquer d'autres idées !

### Vous en avez mare de ces details ? et bhe on va vous en débarrasser

Armés de l'étude de gemini sur mon code, j'ai demandé à claude de faire le travail (Faudrais me payer pour laisser gemini s'approcher de ma codebase en ecriture !).

Une fois finis, je luiai demandé de créer un plan plus precis pour les fonctionnalités supplémentaires que j'ai choisies

- système de panier
- système de projet
- intégration GitHub
- profils créateurs

Il l'a tres grâcieusement fait pendant que je commençais à tester l'application.

Click frenetique et topotage systématiques, passage d'erreur en erreur, indexation par petits groupes, envoyé a l'agent qui n'en fait qu'une bouchée !

C'est l'occasion parfaite pour commencer à examiner le code... oui oui, que maintenant.

En vrai, J'y etais depuis moins de 3 heures et j'ai commancé ma carriere a une époque où tout mettre en place pour dev une application prenait probablement aussi longtemps donc...

je ne dis pas que c'est bien, mais ca fait une bonne douzaine de fois que je commence du dev comme ca et je sais à quoi m'attendre en terme de code.

La chasse aux bugs a pris environ une heure, rien de majeur, "use client" manquant, mauvaise gestion d'état, logique trop compliquée, un tas d'alertes et de prompts, en bref, les spécialités de claude (et j'ai pas subi les gradients bleu violacé cette fois-ci ...)

L'implémentation du plan d'amélioration ? Pareil, simple efficace, en 3-4h de plus :

```
dans @improvements.md implémenter la phase/partie ...
```

### Un jour à la fois

Bon... ce post devient long, et comme c'est la fin du jour 1, je vais m'arrêter ici :D !

À ce moment-là, j'avais une app quasi fonctionnelle, avec un côté admin, les composants et les outils pouvaient être ajoutés.

_je vais les laisser comme ca aussi les suivantes, le jours ou l'IA traduit les ryhmes, on est cuit les lapins!_

Et alors que mes yeux se fermaient tous, je ne pouvais pas voir les ombres qui se formaient.

Me couvrant de joie et de chaleur pour mon application qui fonctionnait comme un charme.

Une petite idée innocente qui deviendrait... [trouvez-moi un nom de quelque chose de mauvais se terminant par le son a, j'ai besoin d'une rime].

En attendant, voici la [démo](https://cn-registry.dev) et le [dépôt](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/cn-registry). Vos retours sont, comme toujours, grandement appréciés !
b:T11ee,
Hello everyone, I’d like to introduce LiteChat, a project I created.

[Repository](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat) and download link [here](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases) (available in French, English, Spanish, Italian, and German).

LiteChat is an AI chat application I built to interact with both local and remote LLMs—all within your browser. It’s designed with a "local-first" philosophy, requiring only an HTTP server to run, with everything else handled in your browser! No tracking, no accounts—you bring your own API keys. Data is saved in an IndexedDB database, and you can synchronize your conversations using Git.

Yes, entirely in the browser! 😛 To make this work, I also implemented a virtual file system (again, all in the browser). You can clone repos and include files from the VFS in your conversations! But manually selecting files was tedious, so I integrated tools for managing the VFS and Git.

With the core architecture in place, I added support for HTTP MCP servers. However, standard stdio servers were still missing, so I also built a bridge (rewritten by AI from `mcp-proxy`) to make them work (you can deploy it anywhere, but it’s not secure!).

Sure, AI is fun, but I was getting tired of text-only interactions. So, I added support for Mermaid diagrams and HTML forms (now you don’t even need to think about how to phrase your requests!). Sure, Mermaid diagrams aren’t the prettiest, but since I added a workflow module with visualizations based on [reactflow.dev](https://reactflow.dev), I also included a way for LLMs to generate them! And since plain text isn’t very engaging, there’s also a "Beat" block that uses [strudel.cc](http://strudel.cc/) to add auditory feedback.

Testing was getting repetitive, so I created a prompt library with templates—now you just fill in a form! (Okay, maybe I also needed it for workflows…)

What’s an Agent, you ask? It’s a system prompt, tools, and task-specific prompts! So, you also get a library for those.

Prompts and agents can integrate into workflows (that’s what they’re designed for!), but you also have transformation steps, user code execution, and custom prompts to facilitate transitions.

As you might have guessed, if I have a way to execute code in workflows, why not run AI-generated code? Yes, you can! In Python or JavaScript. And if you’re feeling adventurous, you can run JavaScript in "unsafe" mode (`eval` and all—that’s code for "yolo" 😆). This can produce cool stuff, like [this one-shot Three.js scroll shooter](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html). You can export it in one click (the template is a bit ugly, but I’ll improve it!).

To avoid losing context, all these UI blocks can be "activated" (or rather, suggested) using rules. Of course, you can add your own rules! There’s even a button to ask the AI to pick the best ones for your current prompt.

You also get the usual regenerate (with a different model if you like) and forking options. You can even edit responses manually to remove unnecessary parts. Code blocks are also editable with syntax highlighting for common languages (but no autocompletion or fancy features—let’s not push grandma into the bushes!).

To top it all off, you can organize AI "races" with an unlimited number of participants (though that depends on your budget, haha). It’s great for benchmarking or seeing which model will replace us first. I even built a small tool that takes exported race conversations and turns them into a benchmark site (currently more focused on the JS execution block: [https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html) for the "game" mentioned earlier).

I’m sure I forgot a few things, but you’ve got the gist! 😊

The hosted version is on GitHub Pages, with no tracking and no accounts! You bring your own API keys. You probably won’t be able to use the hosted version for your local LLM due to HTTPS/HTTP restrictions, but as I said, you can [download it](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases) and host it with a simple HTTP server. There are also localized versions for French, Italian, German, and Spanish. A short (and incomplete) tutorial playlist if you’re feeling lost: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Doe56gCsNRdNyfetOYPQw_JkPHO3XVh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Doe56gCsNRdNyfetOYPQw_JkPHO3XVh)

I hope you enjoy it, and constructive feedback is greatly appreciated! 😊

c:T156f,
Salut a tous, pour mon premier post, je vous presente LiteChat dont je sui le créateur.

[Repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat) et ici [pour télécharger](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases) (en francais, anglais, espagnol, italien et allemand).



C’est un chat IA que j’ai créé pour pouvoir utiliser des LLM locaux et distant, le tout dans votre navigateur. Il est conçu pour être “local first” et n’a besoin que d’un serveur HTTP pour fonctionner, tout le reste c’est dans votre navigateur ! Pas de tracking, pas de compte, vous venez avec vos clé d’API ! Les données sont sauvegardées dans une base de données IndexeDB et vous pouvez synchroniser vos conversations en utilisant git.

Oui, dans le navigateur :P Pour ce faire, j’ai aussi dû implémenter un système de fichiers virtuel (oui, toujour dans le navigateur en utilisant ). Vous avez donc accès aux deux, tant qu’a faire ! Vous pouvez cloner un repo et joindre des fichiers du VFS dans vos conversations !

Mais comme la sélection manuelle des fichiers, c’était une corvée, j’ai intégré des outils pour le VFS et git !

Ensuite, comme l’architecture de base était là, et bien j’ai ajouté le support des serveurs MCP HTTP, mais il manquait toujours les serveurs stdio …, donc j’ai aussi “fait” un bridge (réécrit par l’IA à partir de mcp-proxy ) pour les utiliser (vous pouvez le déployer où vous voulez mais ce n’est pas sécurisé !)

Apres, c’est bien mignon l’IA, mais j’en avais un peu marre du texte seul, du coup, j’ai ajouté le support des diagrammes Mermaid et des formulaires HTML (Comme ca on a meme plus besoin de réfléchir a quoi lui dire a la machine !). Bon… après…les diagrammes Mermaid c’est un peu moche, et comme j’ai ajouté un module de workflow avec des visualisations basée sur [https://reactflow.dev/], j’ai aussi ajouté un moyen pour les LLM de vous en créer ! Et puis comme le text ca fait pas beaucoup de bruit, il y a aussi in block “Beat” qui utilise (http://strudel.cc/) pour aussi en profiter de maniere auditive !

Et puis bon, en testant, toujours taper les mêmes prompts avec juste quelques différences c’était lourd aussi, j’ai donc fait un module de bibliothèque de prompts avec des modèles pour qu’y ai plus qu’a remplir un formulaire ;) (peut etre aussi que j’en avais besoin pour les workflows…)

‘Pis, un Agents, c’est quoi ? hein ? bah un prompt système, des outils et des prompts spécifiques pour les tâches ! Donc ça aussi vous en avez une librairie !

Les prompts et les agents peuvent s’intégrer dans les workflows (duh, ils étaient faits pour ça !) mais vous avez aussi des étapes de “transformation”/exécution de code utilisateur/“prompt personnalisé” pour faciliter le transit !

Comme vous l’avez peut-être deviné, si j’ai une forme d’exécution de code pour les workflows, Est ce que je pourrais t’y donc pas faire tourner le code généré par l’IA, hein ? Eeeeh bha SI ! En Python ou JavaScript Et même que si vous ête un dinguo, vous pouvez faire tourner le js en mode “unsafe” (eval et yolo XD) du coup ca peut produire des trucs (comme ce one shot threejs scroll shooter ) que vous pouvez exporter en 1 clic (le template est moche mais je vais y travailler !)

Afin de n’pas completement obliterer le context, tous ces jolis blocs d’UI peuvent être “activés” (plutôt suggérés ^^) en utilisant des règles. Evidement, vous pouvez ajouter vos règles a vous ! Et meme que vous avez un bouton pour demander a l’IA de les choisir pour vous pour votre prompt actuel !

Bien sûr, vous avez les habituels regen (avec un modèle différent si le coeur vous en dis) et forking, mais vous pouvez aussi modifier une réponse a la main pour dégager l’inutile. D’ailleur, Les blocs de code sont aussi modifiable avec la coloration syntaxique pour les langages les plus courants, (mais pas d’auto-complétion ou autre truc de bogoss, on va pas poussez mémé dans les orties !).

Pour couronner le tout, vous pouvez organiser des courses d’IA avec un nombre illimité de participants (ca dependra de la profondeur de votre portefeuille :P). C’est cool pour faire des benchmarks ou quand on veut voir laquelle des machines prendra notre place en premier… J’ai même fait un petit outil qui prend une conversation de course exportée et qui crée un mini site de benchmark (plus ciblé sur le bloc d’exécution JS pour l’instant https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html pour le “jeu” d’avant)

J’oublie certainement quelques bricoles, mais vous avez compris l’essentiel ^^

La version hébergée est sur les pages GitHub et il n’y a pas de tracking, pas de compte ! Vous apportez vos propres clés API ! Vous ne pourrez probablement pas utiliser la version hébergée pour votre LLM local à cause des restrictions https/http, mais comme je l’ai dit, vous pouvez télécharger https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases et héberger avec un simple serveur HTTP. Vous avez même des versions localisées pour le français, l’italien, l’allemand et l’espagnol. Une petite playlist (très incomplète) de tutoriels si vous vous sentez un peu perdu https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Doe56gCsNRdNyfetOYPQw_JkPHO3XVh

J’espère que vous apprécierez et les commentaires constructifs sont grandement appréciés :Dd:T257e,

So, who here builds **React forms**? And by forms I mean the good kind. With validation, multi-step wizards, conditional logic, and... well, not state of the art things that take you a week to build.

Yeah. It's ok. We've all been there. I mean, have you ever tried to build a proper form system from scratch? It's a whole kerfuffle! Between validation, field types, conditional rendering, and let's not even talk about persistence... 😛

Well. "NO MORE!" I say!

## Meet Formedible

[Formedible](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/formedible) is what happens when you take [TanStack Form v1](https://tanstack.com/form/latest) (already pretty awesome) and wrap it in a nice, user-friendly package with enterprise-grade features. Currently at v0.3.13, so early days but getting there!

What you get out of the box:

* **22+ built-in field types** — text, email, password, select, combobox, date, time, location, file upload, arrays, objects, and a whole bunch more
* **Multi-page forms** — with progress tracking and step navigation
* **Schema-first validation** — powered by Zod (we like type safety around here)
* **Conditional logic** — show/hide fields based on other field values
* **Dynamic options** — load options from APIs, filter them, whatever you need
* **Template interpolation** — use `{{fieldName}}` syntax in labels, descriptions, options... pretty handy
* **Real-time analytics** — track form completion, field-level analytics, abandonment... the whole shebang
* **Form persistence** — localStorage, sessionStorage, whatever you need
* **Visual form builder** — sometimes you just want to click things together
* **AI-powered form builder** — yeah, AI generates forms for you now
* **Component override system** — customize everything if you feel adventurous

## Quick start

Oh, I know you lot are impatient nerds. (At least I am...)

```bash
# install the core package
bun add formedible

# or if you're feeling fancy and want everything
bun add formedible formedible-builder formedible-ai-builder formedible-parser
```

A simple form:

```tsx
import { createFormSchema } from 'formedible'
import { z } from 'zod'

const schema = createFormSchema({
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'name',
      type: 'text',
      label: 'Your name',
      validation: z.string().min(2, "C'mon, give me more than 2 characters!"),
    },
    {
      name: 'email',
      type: 'email',
      label: 'Your email',
      validation: z.string().email("That's not a valid email, mate"),
    },
    {
      name: 'country',
      type: 'select',
      label: 'Where you from?',
      options: ['France', 'UK', 'Germany', 'Other'],
    },
  ],
})

import { FormedibleForm } from 'formedible'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <FormedibleForm schema={schema} onSubmit={(data) => console.log(data)}>
      <FormedibleForm.Field name="name" />
      <FormedibleForm.Field name="email" />
      <FormedibleForm.Field name="country" />
      <FormedibleForm.Submit>Submit</FormedibleForm.Submit>
    </FormedibleForm>
  )
}
```

Easy as pie? Well. Hopefully easier than pie, because pie is actually quite hard to make well...

## Under the hood

Built Formedible as a monorepo with a few packages (because everyone loves monorepos, right? ... right?):

- **formedible** — the core library, what you'll use 90% of the time
- **formedible-builder** — visual form builder, drag & drop style
- **formedible-ai-builder** — AI-powered form generation (experimental, but cool)
- **formedible-parser** — parse form schemas and generate different outputs

Tech stack is pretty modern:

* **React 19.1+** — living in the future
* **TanStack Form v1.23+** — the form library that does the heavy lifting
* **Zod v4.0+** — validation and type safety
* **shadcn/ui** — nice UI components out of the box
* **TailwindCSS 4.1+** — styling, because who has time to write CSS these days?
* **Turborepo** — managing the monorepo, builds, and all that jazz

## The field types

Right, so I mentioned 22+ field types... here's the main ones:

* **Text inputs** — text, password, textarea, number
* **Selection** — select, multi-select, combobox, radio, checkbox, checkbox-group
* **Date & time** — date, time, datetime, date-range
* **Files** — file-upload, image-upload
* **Special** — location, phone, url, color, rating, slider, toggle
* **Complex** — array, object, nested forms (ooh, fancy)

Not enough? Build your own. I made it extensible (you're welcome 😊).

## Multi-page forms

One of the things I'm actually quite proud of. Not state of the art (nothing around here is), but it does the job pretty well:

```tsx
const schema = createFormSchema({
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'personal',
      type: 'object',
      label: 'Personal Info',
      fields: [
        { name: 'name', type: 'text', label: 'Your name' },
        { name: 'email', type: 'email', label: 'Your email' },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: 'address',
      type: 'object',
      label: 'Address',
      fields: [
        { name: 'street', type: 'text', label: 'Street' },
        { name: 'city', type: 'text', label: 'City' },
      ],
    },
  ],
})

function MultiStepForm() {
  return (
    <FormedibleForm schema={schema} onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <FormedibleForm.Step step="personal">
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.name" />
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.email" />
        <FormedibleForm.Next>Next</FormedibleForm.Next>
      </FormedibleForm.Step>

      <FormedibleForm.Step step="address">
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.street" />
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.city" />
        <FormedibleForm.Submit>Submit</FormedibleForm.Submit>
      </FormedibleForm.Step>

      <FormedibleForm.Progress />
    </FormedibleForm>
  )
}
```

See? Not too scary, is it?

## Conditional logic

This is where things get interesting. Show/hide fields based on other field values:

```tsx
const schema = createFormSchema({
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'hasExperience',
      type: 'checkbox',
      label: 'Do you have experience with React forms?',
    },
    {
      name: 'experienceYears',
      type: 'number',
      label: 'How many years?',
      showWhen: {
        field: 'hasExperience',
        operator: 'equals',
        value: true,
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

Nested conditions, multiple conditions, all sorts of stuff. Won't go into all the details here (we'd be here all day), but the documentation has the full scoop.

## Analytics

So, I added analytics because... well, why not? Sometimes you actually want to know how people interact with your forms:

```tsx
<FormedibleForm
  schema={schema}
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  analytics={{
    enabled: true,
    onFieldFocus: (field) => console.log('User focused on', field),
    onFieldBlur: (field) => console.log('User left', field),
    onFieldChange: (field, value) => console.log('User changed', field, 'to', value),
    onStepChange: (step) => console.log('User moved to step', step),
  }}
>
```

Not Google Analytics (thank god), but gives you enough to understand what's happening with your forms.

## Persistence

Ever filled out a long form, then accidentally closed the tab? Yeah, me too. It's awful. So I built in persistence:

```tsx
<FormedibleForm
  schema={schema}
  persistence={{
    enabled: true,
    storage: 'localStorage', // or 'sessionStorage'
    key: 'my-form-data',
  }}
>
```

Now when users come back, their data is still there. They'll thank you. Maybe not out loud, but in their hearts, they're thanking you.

## The visual builder

If you're not the coding type (or just lazy, which I respect), there's a visual builder. Not the best thing since sliced bread, but decent:

```bash
bun add formedible-builder
bunx formedible-builder
```

Starts a web interface where you can drag & drop fields, configure them, and export the schema. Pretty handy when prototyping.

## The AI builder

Still experimental, but pretty cool. Describe a form, AI generates it for you:

```bash
bun add formedible-ai-builder
bunx formedible-ai-builder "I need a registration form with name, email, password, address fields"
```

Not perfect (nothing is), but getting better. Sometimes gets things wrong, sometimes gives weird field types... but when it works, it's like magic ✨

## What still needs work

Look, I'll be honest with you here (as I should be):

* Documentation is... adequate, but could be better
* The AI builder is hit or miss sometimes
* Some field types don't have all the options you might expect
* Performance on very large forms (100+ fields) could be better
* The visual builder could use more polish
* I'm sure there are bugs I haven't found yet (because I'm the only one using it...)

But hey, it's open source and I'm actively working on it. If you find bugs, have suggestions, or just want to say "hey, this is actually pretty good," open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/formedible).

## What now?

Have at it! Try it out, build some forms, break things, let me know what works and what doesn't.

If you're interested in contributing, there's plenty to do. Documentation, bug fixes, new field types, better AI prompts... the list goes on.

The repository is [here](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/formedible) and the documentation is [here](https://formedible.dev) (well, it will be there once I finish setting it up... it's a work in progress, ok?).

Thanks for the read. Hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D)

Alors, qui ici construit des **formulaires React** ? Et par formulaires, j'entends les bons. Avec validation, assistants multi-étapes, logique conditionnelle, et... enfin, pas des trucs à la pointe de l'art qui vous prennent une semaine à construire.

Ouais. C'est ok. On est tous passés par là. Je mean, vous avez déjà essayé de construire un système de formulaires propre à partir de zéro ? C'est tout un bordel ! Entre la validation, les types de champs, l'affichage conditionnel, et parlons même pas de la persistance... 😛

Bon. "PLUS ÇA !" je dis !

## Meet Formedible

[Formedible](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/formedible) c'est ce qui arrive quand vous prenez [TanStack Form v1](https://tanstack.com/form/latest) (déjà vachement bien) et que vous l'enveloppez dans un joli paquet user-friendly avec des fonctionnalités de niveau entreprise. Actuellement en v0.3.13, donc tout début mais ça avance !

Ce que vous obtenez out-of-the-box :

* **22+ types de champs intégrés** — text, email, password, select, combobox, date, time, location, upload de fichiers, arrays, objects, et tout un tas d'autres
* **Formulaires multi-pages** — avec suivi de progression et navigation par étapes
* **Validation first-schema** — propulsée par Zod (on aime la type safety par ici)
* **Logique conditionnelle** — afficher/masquer des champs basés sur les valeurs d'autres champs
* **Options dynamiques** — chargez des options depuis des APIs, filtrez-les, tout ce dont vous avez besoin
* **Interpolation de template** — utilisez la syntaxe `{{fieldName}}` dans les labels, descriptions, options... plutôt pratique
* **Analytics en temps réel** — suivez la complétion des formulaires, analytics au niveau champ, abandon... tout le bazar
* **Persistance des formulaires** — localStorage, sessionStorage, tout ce dont vous avez besoin
* **Constructeur visuel de formulaires** — parfois vous voulez juste cliquer des trucs ensemble
* **Constructeur de formulaires AI-powered** — ouais, l'IA génère des formulaires pour vous maintenant
* **Système de override de composants** — customisez tout si vous vous sentez aventureux

## Démarrage rapide

Oh, je sais que vous êtes tous des nerds impatients. (En tout cas je le suis...)

```bash
# installer le package core
bun add formedible

# ou si vous vous sentez fantaisiste et que vous voulez tout
bun add formedible formedible-builder formedible-ai-builder formedible-parser
```

Un simple formulaire :

```tsx
import { createFormSchema } from 'formedible'
import { z } from 'zod'

const schema = createFormSchema({
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'name',
      type: 'text',
      label: 'Your name',
      validation: z.string().min(2, "C'mon, give me more than 2 characters!"),
    },
    {
      name: 'email',
      type: 'email',
      label: 'Your email',
      validation: z.string().email("That's not a valid email, mate"),
    },
    {
      name: 'country',
      type: 'select',
      label: 'Where you from?',
      options: ['France', 'UK', 'Germany', 'Other'],
    },
  ],
})

import { FormedibleForm } from 'formedible'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <FormedibleForm schema={schema} onSubmit={(data) => console.log(data)}>
      <FormedibleForm.Field name="name" />
      <FormedibleForm.Field name="email" />
      <FormedibleForm.Field name="country" />
      <FormedibleForm.Submit>Submit</FormedibleForm.Submit>
    </FormedibleForm>
  )
}
```

Simple comme tout ? Bon. Espérons que c'est plus simple que la tarte, parce que la tarte en fait c'est assez dur à réussir bien...

## Sous le capot

J'ai construit Formedible comme un monorepo avec quelques packages (parce que tout le monde aime les monorepos, non ? ... non ?) :

- **formedible** — la librairie core, ce que vous utiliserez 90% du temps
- **formedible-builder** — constructeur visuel de formulaires, style drag & drop
- **formedible-ai-builder** — génération de formulaires AI-powered (expérimental, mais cool)
- **formedible-parser** — parse les schémas de formulaires et génère différents outputs

La stack technique est plutôt moderne :

* **React 19.1+** — on vit dans le futur
* **TanStack Form v1.23+** — la librairie de formulaires qui fait le gros du travail
* **Zod v4.0+** — validation et type safety
* **shadcn/ui** — des composants UI sympas out-of-the-box
* **TailwindCSS 4.1+** — styling, parce que qui a le temps d'écrire du CSS de nos jours ?
* **Turborepo** — gérer le monorepo, les builds, et tout ce bazar

## Les types de champs

Bon, donc j'ai mentionné 22+ types de champs... voici les principaux :

* **Text inputs** — text, password, textarea, number
* **Sélection** — select, multi-select, combobox, radio, checkbox, checkbox-group
* **Date & time** — date, time, datetime, date-range
* **Fichiers** — file-upload, image-upload
* **Spécial** — location, phone, url, color, rating, slider, toggle
* **Complexe** — array, object, formulaires imbriqués (ooh, fantaisiste)

Pas assez ? Construisez les vôtres. Je l'ai fait extensible (de rien 😊).

## Formulaires multi-pages

Un des trucs dont je suis plutôt fier. Pas à la pointe de l'art (rien n'est à la pointe de l'art par ici), mais ça fait assez bien le taf :

```tsx
const schema = createFormSchema({
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'personal',
      type: 'object',
      label: 'Personal Info',
      fields: [
        { name: 'name', type: 'text', label: 'Your name' },
        { name: 'email', type: 'email', label: 'Your email' },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: 'address',
      type: 'object',
      label: 'Address',
      fields: [
        { name: 'street', type: 'text', label: 'Street' },
        { name: 'city', type: 'text', label: 'City' },
      ],
    },
  ],
})

function MultiStepForm() {
  return (
    <FormedibleForm schema={schema} onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <FormedibleForm.Step step="personal">
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.name" />
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.email" />
        <FormedibleForm.Next>Next</FormedibleForm.Next>
      </FormedibleForm.Step>

      <FormedibleForm.Step step="address">
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.street" />
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.city" />
        <FormedibleForm.Submit>Submit</FormedibleForm.Submit>
      </FormedibleForm.Step>

      <FormedibleForm.Progress />
    </FormedibleForm>
  )
}
```

Vous voyez ? Pas trop effrayant, non ?

## Logique conditionnelle

C'est là que ça devient intéressant. Affichez/masquez des champs basés sur les valeurs d'autres champs :

```tsx
const schema = createFormSchema({
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'hasExperience',
      type: 'checkbox',
      label: 'Do you have experience with React forms?',
    },
    {
      name: 'experienceYears',
      type: 'number',
      label: 'How many years?',
      showWhen: {
        field: 'hasExperience',
        operator: 'equals',
        value: true,
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

Conditions imbriquées, conditions multiples, tout un tas de trucs. Je vais pas entrer dans tous les détails ici (on serait là toute la journée), mais la documentation a toutes les infos.

## Analytics

Donc, j'ai ajouté des analytics parce que... bah, pourquoi pas ? Parfois vous voulez vraiment savoir comment les gens interagissent avec vos formulaires :

```tsx
<FormedibleForm
  schema={schema}
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  analytics={{
    enabled: true,
    onFieldFocus: (field) => console.log('User focused on', field),
    onFieldBlur: (field) => console.log('User left', field),
    onFieldChange: (field, value) => console.log('User changed', field, 'to', value),
    onStepChange: (step) => console.log('User moved to step', step),
  }}
>
```

Pas Google Analytics (merci dieu), mais ça vous donne assez pour comprendre ce qui se passe avec vos formulaires.

## Persistance

Vous avez déjà rempli un long formulaire, puis fermé l'onglet par erreur ? Ouais, moi aussi. C'est horrible. Donc j'ai intégré la persistance :

```tsx
<FormedibleForm
  schema={schema}
  persistence={{
    enabled: true,
    storage: 'localStorage', // ou 'sessionStorage'
    key: 'my-form-data',
  }}
>
```

Maintenant quand les utilisateurs reviennent, leurs données sont toujours là. Ils vous remercieront. Peut-être pas à voix haute, mais dans leur cœur, ils vous remercient.

## Le constructeur visuel

Si vous n'êtes pas du genre à coder (ou juste flemmard, ce que je respecte), il y a un constructeur visuel. Pas la meilleure chose depuis le pain tranché, mais ça se défend :

```bash
bun add formedible-builder
bunx formedible-builder
```

Ça lance une interface web où vous pouvez drag & drop des champs, les configurer, et exporter le schéma. Plutôt pratique quand vous prototyppez.

## Le constructeur AI

Toujours expérimental, mais plutôt cool. Décrivez un formulaire, l'IA le génère pour vous :

```bash
bun add formedible-ai-builder
bunx formedible-ai-builder "I need a registration form with name, email, password, address fields"
```

Pas parfait (rien ne l'est), mais ça s'améliore. Parfois ça se trompe, parfois ça donne des types de champs bizarres... mais quand ça marche, c'est magique ✨

## Ce qui a encore besoin de boulot

Écoutez, je vais être honnête avec vous (comme je devrais l'être) :

* La documentation est... adequate, mais pourrait être meilleure
* Le constructeur AI est parfois hit or miss
* Certains types de champs n'ont pas toutes les options que vous pourriez attendre
* Les performances sur les très gros formulaires (100+ champs) pourraient être meilleures
* Le constructeur visuel pourrait utiliser plus de polish
* Je suis sûr qu'il y a des bugs que je n'ai pas encore trouvés (parce que je suis le seul à l'utiliser...)

Mais hey, c'est open source et je travaille activement dessus. Si vous trouvez des bugs, avez des suggestions, ou voulez juste dire "hey, c'est plutôt pas mal", ouvrez une issue sur [GitHub](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/formedible).

## Et maintenant ?

Faites-vous plaisir ! Essayez-le, construisez des formulaires, cassez des trucs, dites-moi ce qui marche et ce qui ne marche pas.

Si vous êtes intéressé par contribuer, il y a plein à faire. Documentation, fix de bugs, nouveaux types de champs, meilleurs prompts AI... la liste continue.

Le repo est [ici](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/formedible) et la documentation est [ici](https://formedible.dev) (enfin, elle y sera une fois que j'aurai fini de la mettre en place... c'est un travail en cours, ok ?).

Merci d'avoir lu. J'espère que vous avez trouvé ça utile (ou au moins divertissant :D)

f:T1e1b,
_This content has been generated by GLM 4.7 AI model_

So, you know how everyone's benchmarking LLMs these days? Like, "oh look, this model scored 87.3% on this synthetic test suite" or whatever. Boring, right? I mean, who cares if a model can reverse a string perfectly when you'll never ask it to reverse a string in real life? 😛

That's why I built **RaceBench** — a benchmarking tool that actually tests something useful. How well different LLMs can write real, working JavaScript code. Not some "hello world" nonsense, but actual creative coding tasks — games, visualisations, interactive stuff you might actually want to build.

## The idea (because every project needs an origin story)

One day I was curious: if I ask different AI models to write the same game, which one would actually produce playable code? Not "technically correct but crashes on the third frame" code, but stuff you could run and enjoy.

So I created a benchmark where I ask models to build a 2D scroll shooter game using Three.js. Not exactly "easy mode" for an AI — it requires understanding 3D graphics, game loops, user input, and making everything work together without blowing up the browser. Spoiler: some models handle it beautifully, others... well, let's say it's educational to watch them try 😊

## What it actually does

RaceBench is a static HTML dashboard that displays results from testing various LLMs on JavaScript code generation. Here's the cool part:

- **Real-world benchmarking** — we test creative coding tasks, not synthetic "reverse this string" nonsense
- **Executable results** — every model's output can be run directly. See the code, click preview, judge for yourself
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** — not just "did it work?" We track prompt tokens, completion tokens, TTFT (time to first token), generation time, and success rate
- **Educational value** — compare how different models structure their code, their approaches to the same problem, and learn from the variety (even the bad ones!)

## How it works (the technical bits, minus the boring parts)

### The setup

Everything's static — pure HTML/CSS/JS with no backend. Deploy it anywhere. GitHub Pages? Sure. Netlify? Why not. Your Raspberry Pi at home? Absolutely. The whole thing weighs about as much as a small hamster 🐹

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/racebench.git

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (or your jungle site of choice)
# I mean, whatever floats your boat
```

### The test case

The benchmark uses a 2D scroll shooter game built with Three.js as the test scenario. Each model gets the same prompt and has to produce working code. We extract the last ````runjs` code block from each response (because models love to chat before giving you the goods, you know?).

### What we track

For each model, RaceBench captures:

- **Prompt tokens** — how much it needed to understand what we wanted
- **Completion tokens** — how verbose it got with the solution
- **TTFT** (Time To First Token) — responsiveness metrics
- **Generation time** — total time to produce the code
- **Success rate** — did it actually run? Or did it explode?

### The UI (because I care about aesthetics, surprisingly)

Nice dark mode UI that doesn't look like it was designed by a sysadmin in 2003. Two view modes:

- **Card grid** — pretty cards for each model with key metrics at a glance
- **Sortable table** — for when you want to data-nerd out and sort by TTFT or token count

Click any model and you get:
- Live preview (opens in a new tab, runs the actual code)
- Raw response view (see exactly what the model said)
- All the metrics broken down

## Versions (because software never ends)

### v1: The brave beginning

Tested 18 models. Learned a lot. Realised some models are impressively creative while others are... trying their best. Let's put it that way. 😛

### v2: The refinement

Narrowed it down to 10 models. Better metrics extraction. Cleaner UI. Still watching models struggle with Three.js in entertaining ways.

## Tech stack (kept it simple, you're welcome)

- **Node.js** — because JavaScript is life
- **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)** — styling without the build step headaches
- **Simple-Datatables** — for when you want sortable tables but don't want to write them yourself
- **Three.js (dynamic)** — loaded on demand for the live previews

Minimal dependencies. No complex build pipelines. Just works. I like that philosophy.

## The models (participants in the chaos)

We've tested a bunch of the big names:

- Claude Sonnet 4
- DeepSeek R1
- GPT-4.1
- Gemini 2.5
- Grok 4
- Kimi K2
- Qwen3
- ...and more

Each one brings its own personality to the code. Some are terse and efficient. Others are verbose and over-engineered. A few produce code that makes you question everything you know about software development. All educational in their own way 😊

## See it in action

Don't just take my word for it — go play with the actual dashboard:

**[Live Demo](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html)**

Click around. Run some code. See which model you'd want on your team. Spoiler: the answer might surprise you (or it might be exactly what you expect. LLMs are weird like that).

## What makes this different from other benchmarks?

I'm glad you asked (I know you didn't, but pretend you did) 😛

1. **Real tasks, not toy problems** — we test actual creative coding, not "sort this array" nonsense
2. **You can run the results** — not just a score, actual working code you can inspect and execute
3. **No server needed** — static HTML means you can host it anywhere or even run it locally
4. **Transparent metrics** — see exactly what we measured and how
5. **Educational** — compare approaches, learn patterns, see what works (and what definitely doesn't)

## What I learned (because building stuff teaches you things)

- Some models are surprisingly good at 3D graphics code
- Others clearly haven't seen many Three.js examples in their training
- TTFT doesn't always correlate with code quality
- Verbose models aren't necessarily better — sometimes they're just... chatty
- The best model depends on what you value: speed, efficiency, code clarity, or just getting something that runs

## Future plans (the "if I get around to it" section)

I'd like to:

- Add more test cases (different types of creative coding challenges)
- Test more models (new ones keep popping up like mushrooms)
- Improve the metrics (maybe add code quality scoring?)
- Add a "leaderboard" view for those who love rankings
- Maybe, possibly, contribute the data to some broader benchmark effort (if such a thing exists and wants this kind of real-world data)

But let's be honest — I'll probably add a new test case before I remember to do any of that. Priorities, right? 😊

## Wrapping up

RaceBench isn't trying to be the definitive AI benchmark. It's just me trying to answer a simple question: "Which AI writes the best JavaScript code for real projects?" And having fun seeing them all try.

If you find it useful, great. If you learn something from the different code styles, even better. If you just enjoy clicking through live previews of AI-generated games and thinking "wow, that actually works," then I've done my job.

Feel free to fork it, add your own models, test different prompts. The more data, the better. Just don't ask me which model is "best" — that depends on what you're building, your timeline, your budget, and probably the phase of the moon. LLMs are like that 😛

**GitHub:** [DimitriGilbert/racebench](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/racebench)

Now go race some models. May the best code win.

10:T23a9,
_Ce contenu a été généré par le modèle AI GLM 4.7 et not-ai-writer_

Alors, vous voyez comme tout le monde benchmarke des LLMs en ce moment ? Genre, "oh regarde, ce modèle a score 87,3% sur cette suite de tests synthétique" ou quoi que ce soit dans le genre. Ennuyeux, non ? Je veux dire, on s'en fiche de savoir si un modèle peut inverser une chaîne parfaitement quand on ne lui demandera jamais d'inverser une chaîne dans la vraie vie ? 😛

C'est pour ça que j'ai créé **RaceBench** — un outil de benchmark qui teste vraiment quelque chose d'utile. À quel point différents LLMs peuvent écrire du code JavaScript réel qui fonctionne. Pas des trucs de "hello world" nuls, mais de vraies tâches de code créatif — des jeux, des visualisations, des trucs interactifs que vous pourriez vraiment vouloir construire.

## L'idée (parce que tout projet a besoin d'une histoire d'origine)

Un jour j'étais curieux: si je demande à différents modèles d'IA d'écrire le même jeu, lequel produirait vraiment du code jouable ? Pas du code "techniquement correct mais qui plante à la troisième frame", mais des trucs qu'on pourrait lancer et apprécier.

Donc j'ai créé un benchmark où je demande aux modèles de construire un jeu de tir scroll 2D en utilisant Three.js. Pas vraiment "mode facile" pour une IA — ça demande de comprendre la 3D, les boucles de jeu, les entrées utilisateur, et de faire tout fonctionner ensemble sans faire exploser le navigateur. Spoiler: certains modèles gèrent ça magnifiquement, d'autres... enfin, disons que c'est éducatif de les essayer 😊

## Ce que ça fait vraiment

RaceBench est un dashboard HTML statique qui affiche les résultats de tests de divers LLMs sur la génération de code JavaScript. Voici la partie cool:

- **Benchmarking réel** — on teste des tâches de code créatif, pas des trucs synthétiques du genre "inverse cette chaîne"
- **Résultats exécutables** — la sortie de chaque modèle peut être lancée directement. Voyez le code, cliquez sur preview, jugez par vous-même
- **Analyse multi-dimensionnelle** — pas juste "ça a marché ?" On tracke les tokens de prompt, les tokens de complétion, le TTFT (temps jusqu'au premier token), le temps de génération, et le taux de succès
- **Valeur éducative** — comparez comment différents modèles structurent leur code, leurs approches au même problème, et apprenez de la variété (même des mauvais !)

## Comment ça marche (les bits techniques, moins les parties ennuyeuses)

### Le setup

Tout est statique — du HTML/CSS/JS pur sans backend. Déployez-le n'importe où. GitHub Pages ? Sûr. Netlify ? Pourquoi pas. Votre Raspberry Pi à la maison ? Absolument. Le tout pèse à peu près le poids d'un petit hamster 🐹

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/racebench.git

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (or your jungle site of choice)
# I mean, whatever floats your boat
```

### Le cas de test

Le benchmark utilise un jeu de tir scroll 2D construit avec Three.js comme scénario de test. Chaque modèle reçoit le même prompt et doit produire du code qui fonctionne. On extrait le dernier bloc de code ```runjs de chaque réponse (parce que les modèles adorent discuter avant de vous donner la marchandise, vous voyez ?).

### Ce qu'on tracke

Pour chaque modèle, RaceBench capture:

- **Prompt tokens** — combien il en a eu besoin pour comprendre ce qu'on voulait
- **Completion tokens** — à quel point il a été verbeux avec la solution
- **TTFT** (Time To First Token) — métriques de réactivité
- **Generation time** — temps total pour produire le code
- **Success rate** — ça a vraiment tourné ? Ou ça a explosé ?

### L'UI (parce que je me soucie de l'esthétique, étonnamment)

Une superbe interface dark mode qui n'a pas l'air d'avoir été conçue par un admin sys en 2003. Deux modes de vue:

- **Grille de cartes** — de belles cartes pour chaque modèle avec les métriques clés en un coup d'œil
- **Tableau triable** — pour quand vous voulez faire le data-nerd et trier par TTFT ou nombre de tokens

Cliquez sur n'importe quel modèle et vous obtenez:
- Live preview (s'ouvre dans un nouvel onglet, lance le vrai code)
- Vue de la réponse brute (voyez exactement ce que le modèle a dit)
- Toutes les métriques détaillées

## Versions (parce que le logiciel ne se termine jamais)

### v1: Le début courageux

Testé 18 modèles. Appris beaucoup. Réalisé que certains modèles sont impressionnamment créatifs tandis que d'autres sont... essaient leur meilleur. Mettons les choses comme ça. 😛

### v2: Le raffinement

Réduit à 10 modèles. Meilleure extraction des métriques. UI plus propre. Toujours à regarder les modèles galérer avec Three.js de manière amusante.

## Stack technique (gardé simple, de rien)

- **Node.js** — parce que JavaScript est la vie
- **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)** — du style sans les maux de tête de build
- **Simple-Datatables** — pour quand vous voulez des tableaux triables mais ne voulez pas les écrire vous-même
- **Three.js (dynamique)** — chargé à la demande pour les previews en direct

Dépendances minimales. Pas de pipelines de build complexes. Juste ça marche. J'aime cette philosophie.

## Les modèles (participants dans le chaos)

On a testé plein de grands noms:

- Claude Sonnet 4
- DeepSeek R1
- GPT-4.1
- Gemini 2.5
- Grok 4
- Kimi K2
- Qwen3
- ...et plus

Chacun apporte sa propre personnalité au code. Certains sont laconiques et efficaces. D'autres sont verbeux et sur-ingénierés. Quelques-uns produisent du code qui vous fait remettre en question tout ce que vous savez sur le développement logiciel. Tous éducatifs à leur manière 😊

## Voyez-le en action

Ne me croyez pas sur parole — allez jouer avec le vrai dashboard:

**[Démo Live](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html)**

Cliquez autour. Lancez du code. Voyez quel modèle vous voudriez dans votre équipe. Spoiler: la réponse pourrait vous surprendre (ou elle pourrait être exactement ce que vous attendez. Les LLMs sont bizarres comme ça).

## Ce qui rend ça différent des autres benchmarks ?

Je suis ravi que vous demandiez (je sais que vous n'avez pas demandé, mais faites semblant) 😛

1. **Vraies tâches, pas problèmes jouets** — on teste du code créatif réel, pas des trucs du genre "trie ce tableau"
2. **Vous pouvez lancer les résultats** — pas juste un score, du vrai code qui fonctionne que vous pouvez inspecter et exécuter
3. **Pas de serveur nécessaire** — HTML statique signifie que vous pouvez l'héberger n'importe où ou même le lancer localement
4. **Métriques transparentes** — voyez exactement ce qu'on a mesuré et comment
5. **Éducatif** — comparez les approches, apprenez des patterns, voyez ce qui marche (et ce qui ne marche DEFINITIVEMENT pas)

## Ce que j'ai appris (parce que construire des trucs vous apprend des choses)

- Certains modèles sont étonnamment bons en code graphique 3D
- D'autres n'ont clairement pas vu beaucoup d'exemples Three.js dans leur entraînement
- Le TTFT ne correlate pas toujours avec la qualité du code
- Les modèles verbeux ne sont pas nécessairement meilleurs — parfois ils sont juste... bavards
- Le meilleur modèle dépend de ce que vous valorisez: vitesse, efficacité, clarté du code, ou juste avoir quelque chose qui tourne

## Plans futurs (la section "si je m'y retrouve")

J'aimerais:

- Ajouter plus de cas de test (différents types de défis de code créatif)
- Tester plus de modèles (de nouveaux surgissent comme des champignons)
- Améliorer les métriques (peut-être ajouter un scoring de qualité du code ?)
- Ajouter une vue "leaderboard" pour ceux qui adorent les classements
- Peut-être, possiblement, contribuer les données à un effort de benchmark plus large (si un tel truc existe et veut ce genre de données du monde réel)

Mais soyons honnêtes — j'ajouterai probablement un nouveau cas de test avant de me souvenir de faire quoi que ce soit de tout ça. Les priorités, quoi ? 😊

## Conclusion

RaceBench n'essaie pas d'être le benchmark AI définitif. C'est juste moi qui essaie de répondre à une question simple: "Quelle IA écrit le meilleur code JavaScript pour des projets réels ?" Et m'amuse à les voir tous essayer.

Si vous le trouvez utile, super. Si vous apprenez quelque chose des différents styles de code, encore mieux. Si vous aimez juste cliquer à travers des previews en direct de jeux générés par IA et penser "wow, ça marche vraiment," alors j'ai fait mon boulot.

N'hésitez pas à le forker, ajouter vos propres modèles, tester différents prompts. Plus il y a de données, mieux c'est. Ne me demandez pas quel modèle est "le meilleur" — ça dépend de ce que vous construisez, votre timeline, votre budget, et probablement la phase de la lune. Les LLMs sont comme ça 😛

Maintenant allez faire la course à quelques modèles. Que le meilleur code gagne.

_This content has been generated by GLM 4.7 AI model_

So. Who here has **project ideas**? And among these ideas, some turn into... uh, actual tasks, right?

Ok ok, so, get me a structured plan, broken down tasks, and anything resembling order. Like, right NOW!

Yeah...it's ok. We've all been there 😛.

The wasteland of unorganized thoughts is a dangerous place. But worry not — I built us a bunker.

## Welcome to the Bunker 🏚️

[Task-O-Matic](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic) is an AI-powered task management system with a post-apocalyptic survival bunker theme (because why not?). It takes your chaotic project ideas and turns them into structured, executable task lists through AI assistance.

Think of it as your personal task commander in the aftermath of project anarchy.

## What it actually does 📋

Task-O-Matic isn't state of the art — I'm not a bloody AI researcher — but it *does* work. And it's rather useful for us bunker dwellers:

- **Idea to PRD** : Take your half-baked idea and let AI turn it into a proper Product Requirements Document
- **PRD to tasks** : Break that PRD into actual, doable tasks
- **AI-powered enhancement** : Let the AI improve, split, and plan your tasks
- **Multi-AI generation** : Run multiple AI models in parallel and compare results (battle royale style)
- **External tool integration** : Connect to Opencode, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and more
- **Benchmarking** : Test different AI models with git worktree isolation
- **Existing projects** : Attach Task-O-Matic to projects you already started (`init attach`)
- **Local-first** : Everything lives in `.task-o-matic` (the bunker's archives)
- **Hierarchical breakdown** : Subtasks, sub-subtasks, sub-sub-sub... you get the idea
- **Streaming responses** : Watch the AI think with reasoning tokens

## The tech stack 🔧

Built with tools that survived the apocalypse:

- **TypeScript** — type safety is survival safety
- **Bun** — fast (needed when running from generators)
- **Vercel AI SDK v6** — the magic behind the AI curtain
- **Commander.js** — CLI parsing (I know a thing or two about CLI tools...)
- **Inquirer.js** — interactive prompts (for bunker decisions)
- **Zod** — schema validation (don't want corrupted data in the archives)

## Quick start ⚡

Oh, I know you're impatient. (Me too...)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic
bun install
bun link
task-o-matic init attach
task-o-matic prd generate "Build a survival bunker dashboard"
task-o-matic prd parse
task-o-matic task enhance --all
task-o-matic task execute --ai claude
```

Done.

## Installation 🔨

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic
bun install
bun link
```

Or via npm if you prefer the old ways: `npm install -g @dimitrigilbert/task-o-matic`

## Configuration 🔑

Task-O-Matic needs API keys. Set them as environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Put these in `.env` or your shell profile. Don't commit them to git, obviously.

## How it works 🚀

### Initialize

```bash
task-o-matic init attach    # attach to existing project
task-o-matic init new my-project   # or create new
```

Creates a `.task-o-matic` directory. Like your bunker's storage room.

### Generate a PRD

```bash
task-o-matic prd generate "I want to build a personal finance tracker that works offline, syncs when online, and has dark mode because bunker lights are harsh"
```

The AI will interview you (via inquirer prompts) to clarify requirements and generate a proper PRD.

### Parse into tasks

```bash
task-o-matic prd parse
```

Breaks down your PRD into hierarchical tasks, subtasks, sub-subtasks. Organized by priority and dependencies.

### Enhance and plan

```bash
task-o-matic task enhance --all
task-o-matic task plan
task-o-matic task split --id task-123
```

### Execute

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --ai claude
task-o-matic task execute --all --ai claude,gemini,gpt4
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --tool opencode
```

The AI reads the task description and context, generates code or documentation. You review before committing.

## Multi-AI 🤖

Run multiple AI models in parallel:

```bash
task-o-matic task generate-multi \
  --id task-123 \
  --providers claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --compare
```

See different approaches. Verify the best solution. Like having a council of AI advisors in your bunker 😊

## Benchmarking 📊

```bash
task-o-matic benchmark run \
  --models claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --task-set my-tasks
task-o-matic benchmark results
task-o-matic benchmark compare --run-id run1,run2
```

Uses git worktrees. Clean environments. No contamination!

## Local-first storage 💾

Everything lives in `.task-o-matic/`:

```
.prds/           # Product Requirements Documents
tasks/          # Task definitions and status
history/        # Execution history
benchmarks/     # Benchmark results
config.json     # Your configuration
```

No cloud. No data leaving your bunker (unless you choose to). Your data, your rules.

## Streaming with reasoning tokens 🧠

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --stream
```

Shows reasoning tokens as they're generated. Fascinating to see how the AI approaches problems (sometimes in ways I wouldn't expect, which is good).

## Why the bunker theme? 🤔

I know, I know. It's weird. But here's the thing:

1. It's fun 😛
2. Projects feel like chaotic wastelands
3. A structured system feels like building a safe shelter
4. "Bunker" is a great metaphor for local-first, isolated development
5. Why not?

Also, calling users "citizens" and projects "missions" makes me chuckle. If it makes you smile too, then it's worth it.

## Current status 🚧

Task-O-Matic is at **v0.1.5-beta.1**. Things might break. Features might change. But the core functionality works.

If you find bugs (and I'm sure there are nests of them), open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic/issues). I'm the only user right now, so finding bugs is becoming... challenging 😊

## What's next? 🔮

- More AI provider integrations
- Web UI (because some people prefer graphical interfaces)
- Team collaboration (multi-bunker coordination)
- Plugin system for custom tools
- Better dependency visualization
- Task templates for common project types
- CI/CD integration

Subject to change based on what the wasteland throws at us.

## Get involved! 🤝

This is a side project I built because I needed it. If you find it useful, that's awesome. If you want to contribute, even better!

Star the repo. Open issues. Submit PRs. Share it with other bunker dwellers.

## Final thoughts 💭

Task-O-Matic isn't going to revolutionize project management or anything grand. It's just a tool I built to help me (and hopefully you) turn chaotic ideas into organized, executable tasks.

It's not perfect. It's not the most elegant code I've ever written. But it works. It's useful. And it's mine.

If you're drowning in project chaos and need a structured approach to breaking things down, give it a shot. Worst case, you'll have a cool CLI tool with a bunker theme.

Best case, you'll actually ship that project you've been thinking about for months.

Stay safe out there in the wasteland, citizen. And happy coding!

Alors. Qui ici a des **idées de projets** ? Et parmi ces idées, certaines se transforment en... euh, vraies tâches, non ?

Ok ok, alors, donnez-moi un plan structuré, des tâches détaillées, et tout ce qui ressemble à de l'ordre. Genre, MAINTENANT !

Ouais...c'est bon. On est tous passés par là 😛.

Le wasteland des pensées désorganisées est un endroit dangereux. Mais pas de souci — je nous ai construit un bunker.

## Bienvenue dans le Bunker 🏚️

[Task-O-Matic](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic) est un système de gestion de tâches propulsé par l'IA avec un thème de bunker de survie post-apocalyptique (parce que pourquoi pas ?). Il prend vos idées de projet chaotiques et les transforme en listes de tâches structurées et exécutables grâce à l'IA.

Considérez ça comme votre commandant de tâches personnel dans les suites d'une anarchie de projet.

## Ce que ça fait vraiment 📋

Task-O-Matic n'est pas state of the art — je suis pas un putain de chercheur en IA — mais ça *marche*. Et c'est plutôt utile pour nous, habitants de bunker :

- **Idée vers PRD** : Prenez votre idée à moitié cuite et laissez l'IA la transformer en un vrai Product Requirements Document
- **PRD vers tâches** : Découpez ce PRD en vraies tâches faisables
- **Amélioration propulsée par l'IA** : Laissez l'IA améliorer, diviser et planifier vos tâches
- **Génération multi-IA** : Lancez plusieurs modèles d'IA en parallèle et comparez les résultats (style battle royale)
- **Intégration d'outils externes** : Connectez-vous à Opencode, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, et plus
- **Benchmarking** : Testez différents modèles d'IA avec l'isolation git worktree (un jour peu etre ca sera tester, pour le moment, c'est pure vibe :P)
- **Projets existants** : Attachez Task-O-Matic à des projets que vous avez déjà commencés (`init attach`)
- **Local-first** : Tout vit dans `.task-o-matic` (les archives du bunker)
- **Découpage hiérarchique** : Sous-tâches, sous-sous-tâches, sous-sous-sous... vous voyez l'idée
- **Réponses en streaming** : Regardez l'IA réfléchir avec les tokens de raisonnement

## La stack technique 🔧

Construit avec des outils qui ont survécu à l'apocalypse :

- **TypeScript** — la sûreté des types, c'est la sûreté de survie
- **Bun** — rapide (nécessaire quand on fui les générateurs)
- **Vercel AI SDK v6** — la magie derrière le rideau IA
- **Commander.js** — parsing CLI (je sais un truc ou deux sur les outils CLI...)
- **Inquirer.js** — prompts interactifs (pour les décisions du bunker)
- **Zod** — validation de schéma (pas de données corrompues dans les archives)

- Démarrage rapide ⚡

Oh, je sais que vous êtes impatient. (Moi aussi...)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic
bun install
bun link
task-o-matic init attach
task-o-matic prd generate "Build a survival bunker dashboard"
task-o-matic prd parse
task-o-matic task enhance --all
task-o-matic task execute --ai claude
```

Voilà.

## Installation 🔨

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic
bun install
bun link
```

Ou via npm si vous préférez les vieilles méthodes : `npm install -g @dimitrigilbert/task-o-matic`

## Configuration 🔑

Task-O-Matic a besoin de clés API. Configurez-les comme variables d'environnement :

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Mettez ça dans `.env` ou votre profil de shell. Évidemment, les commit pas dans git.

## Comment ça marche 🚀

### Initialiser

```bash
task-o-matic init attach    # attacher à un projet existant
task-o-matic init new my-project   # ou en créer un nouveau
```

Crée un répertoire `.task-o-matic`. Comme la salle de stockage de votre bunker.

### Générer un PRD

```bash
task-o-matic prd generate "I want to build a personal finance tracker that works offline, syncs when online, and has dark mode because bunker lights are harsh"
```

L'IA va vous interviewer (via les prompts inquirer) pour clarifier les requis et générer un vrai PRD.

### Parser en tâches

```bash
task-o-matic prd parse
```

Découpe votre PRD en tâches hiérarchiques, sous-tâches, sous-sous-tâches. Organisées par priorité et dépendances.

### Améliorer et planifier

```bash
task-o-matic task enhance --all
task-o-matic task plan
task-o-matic task split --id task-123
```

### Exécuter

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --ai claude
task-o-matic task execute --all --ai claude,gemini,gpt4
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --tool opencode
```

L'IA lit la description de la tâche et le contexte, génère du code ou de la documentation. Vous reviewez avant de committer.

## Multi-IA 🤖

Lancez plusieurs modèles d'IA en parallèle :

```bash
task-o-matic task generate-multi \
  --id task-123 \
  --providers claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --compare
```

Voyez différentes approches. Vérifiez la meilleure solution. Comme avoir un conseil d'experts IA dans votre bunker 😊

## Benchmarking 📊

```bash
task-o-matic benchmark run \
  --models claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --task-set my-tasks
task-o-matic benchmark results
task-o-matic benchmark compare --run-id run1,run2
```

Utilise les git worktrees. Environnements propres. Pas de contamination !

## Stockage local-first 💾

Tout vit dans `.task-o-matic/` :

```
.prds/           # Product Requirements Documents
tasks/          # Définitions de tâches et statuts
history/        # Historique d'exécution
benchmarks/     # Résultats de benchmark
config.json     # Votre configuration
```

Pas de cloud. Pas de données qui quittent votre bunker (sauf si vous le choisissez). Vos données, vos règles.

## Streaming avec tokens de raisonnement 🧠

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --stream
```

Affiche les tokens de raisonnement au fur et à mesure qu'ils sont générés. Fascinant de voir comment l'IA aborde les problèmes (parfois de façons que je n'aurais pas attendues, ce qui est bon).

## Pourquoi le thème bunker ? 🤔

Je sais, je sais. C'est bizarre. mais voilà le truc :

1. C'est fun 😛
2. Les projets ressemblent à des wastelands chaotiques
3. Un système structuré ressemble à la construction d'un abri sûr
4. "Bunker" est une super métaphore pour le dev local-first et isolé
5. Pourquoi pas ?

Et puis, appeler les utilisateurs "citoyens" et les projets "missions" me fait pouffer. Si ça vous fait sourire aussi, alors ça en vaut la peine.

## Statut actuel 🚧

Task-O-Matic est en **v0.1.5-beta.1**. Des trucs peuvent casser. Des features peuvent changer. Mais la fonctionnalité core marche.

Si vous trouvez des bugs (et je suis sûr qu'il y a des nids), ouvrez une issue sur [GitHub](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic/issues). Je suis le seul utilisateur pour l'instant, donc trouver des bugs devient... challengeant 😊

## Et après ? 🔮

- Plus d'intégrations de providers IA
- Web UI (parce que certains préfèrent les interfaces graphiques)
- Collaboration d'équipe (coordination multi-bunker)
- Système de plugins pour outils custom
- Meilleure visualisation des dépendances
- Templates de tâches pour types de projets communs
- Intégration CI/CD

Sujet à changement selon ce que le wasteland nous balance.

## Impliquez-vous ! 🤝

C'est un side project que j'ai construit dont j'avais besoin. Si vous le trouvez utile, c'est awesome. Si vous voulez contribuer, encore mieux !

Star le repo. Ouvrez des issues. Soumettez des PRs. Partagez-le avec d'autres habitants de bunker.

## Pensées finales 💭

Task-O-Matic va pas révolutionner la gestion de projet ou quoi que ce soit de grand. C'est juste un outil que j'ai construit pour m'aider (et vous je l'espère) à transformer des idées chaotiques en tâches organisées et exécutables.

C'est pas parfait. C'est pas le code le plus élégant que j'aie jamais écrit. Mais ça marche. C'est utile. Et c'est le mien.

Si vous coulez dans le chaos de projet et avez besoin d'une approche structurée pour découper les choses, essayez-le. Dans le pire des cas, vous aurez un outil CLI cool avec un thème bunker.

Dans le meilleur des cas, vous livrerez enfin ce projet auquel vous pensez depuis des mois.

Restez prudents là-dehors dans le wasteland, citoyen. Et bon code !

_This content has been generated by GLM 4.7 AI model_

So, who here uses **git**? And I mean *really* uses it, not just `commit -m "stuff"` and push it when things break?

Yeah, git is great and all, but sometimes you look at `git log` and it's like trying to read the matrix code upside down. There's so much data there. So many patterns. So many... questions! Like "who actually broke production last month?" or "is this repo a one-person show?" or "why does this file have more commits than my entire project history?"

Well, I got tired of staring at commit hashes, so I built **git-moar**! 😛

## What is git-moar?

[git-moar](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/git-report) is a CLI tool that takes your git repository (or repositories, if you're feeling adventurous) and turns it into a beautiful, interactive HTML report with charts, metrics, and insights that might just make you question your life choices (in a good way... I think).

Two main commands:
* **`snitch`** — analyze a single repository (great for stalking... I mean, understanding... a particular project)
* **`scattered`** — analyze multiple repositories at once (perfect for that "oh god, what have we created" moment)

Think of it as git log, but with actual colors, charts, and the kind of data you can show to management without them falling asleep. Not state of the art, but sure beats `grep`! 😊

## Quick start

```bash
npm install -g git-moar

cd my-project
git-moar snitch

# or analyze multiple repos at once (wildcards work, 'cause magic)
git-moar scattered ~/projects/*/

open git-moar-report.html  # or xdg-open on Linux, or start on Windows
```

## What's in the report?

Ah, the juicy part! 15+ chart types and more metrics than you can shake a branch at.

### Quality metrics (because we all pretend to care)

* **Bus Factor** — how many people need to get hit by a bus before your project dies? Spoiler: probably 1 for most of us
* **Code Churn** — lines added vs deleted, with a "who's actually deleting code" breakdown
* **Health Score** — a number you can use to feel good or terrible about yourself
* **Gini Coefficient** — inequality in contributions, because economics can ruin anything

### Productivity insights (to prove you're not slacking)

* **Peak Hours** — when do you actually commit? 3 AM coffee-fueled sessions or 9-5 corporate slavery?
* **Velocity** — commits over time, with trends and the inevitable "what happened in December" dip
* **Work-Life Balance** — weekend vs weekday commits (prepare to be judged)

### File hotspots (the drama queens of your repo)

* **Frequently Changed Files** — files that get touched more than your phone
* **Knowledge Silos** — files that only one person ever touches (recipe for disaster)

### Other cool stuff

* **Commit Classification** — are you writing features, fixes, docs, or just "update"?
* **Message Quality Scoring** — how terrible are your commit messages? (spoiler: probably very)
* **GitHub-Style Contribution Calendar** — show off your green squares (or lack thereof)
* **Sortable Data Tables** — filter and sort contributors, files, commits, whatever

## Visualizations

The report uses [Chart.js 4.4.0](https://www.chartjs.org/) for all the pretty charts, and let me tell you, I was pretty proud when I got the heatmaps working. Here's what you get:

* Activity trends over time
* Contributor distribution charts
* Commit heatmaps (hourly, daily, weekly)
* File change patterns
* Code churn graphs
* And like 10 more things that I forgot about because there's just so many

Dark/light themes too, because I'm not a monster who forces you to stare at white screens at 2 AM.

## Advanced features

### Templates (for the control freaks)

Don't like my beautifully crafted (read: barely functional) default report? Create your own templates. It's a bit of HTML with some template variables, and if you break it, well... that's on you. I've provided the default template as a starting point, but you can go wild.

### Export options

Sometimes you need data for spreadsheets (or that executive who demands CSV files for some reason). git-moar can export to:

* **CSV** — because Excel still rules the corporate world apparently
* **JSON** — for when you want to parse things programmatically or feed it into some AI that tells you your repo is doomed

### Multi-repo analysis

The `scattered` command is where things get interesting. Analyze multiple repositories and get cross-project insights. Want to know which repo gets the most commits across your whole org? Which contributors are spreading themselves too thin? Who never commits anything anywhere? (looking at you, Dave).

Supports wildcards:

```bash
git-moar scattered ~/projects/*/
git-moar scattered ~/projects/git-*/
git-moar scattered ~/projects/*-backend/ ~/projects/*-frontend/
```

## Tech stack (nerd stuff)

Built with:
* **Node.js** — because I'm too lazy to learn Rust (sue me)
* **Chart.js 4.4.0** — for the charts, obviously
* **Simple-Datatables** — for the sortable tables
* **Chalk** — for colorful terminal output (life is too short for monochrome)
* **SLOC** — for counting lines of code

CLI-based. No servers. No cloud. No subscription fees. Just run it and get your report. Privacy-focused by design (data never leaves your machine).

## What now?

### Install

```bash
npm install -g git-moar
```

Or clone and build if you're one of those people who doesn't trust npm (I get it).

### Run

```bash
# single repo
git-moar snitch

# multi repo
git-moar scattered <path-to-repos>/

# with options (because there's always options)
git-moar snitch --output my-report.html --theme dark --since "2024-01-01"
```

Use `git-moar snitch --help` or `git-moar scattered --help` for all the flags. Quite a few, and I probably forgot to document some of them, so... good luck?

### Share

The generated HTML file is self-contained (charts embedded and everything). Email it, put it on a server, upload it somewhere, whatever. Just one file. No dependencies. No nothing.

## The honest truth

Look, git-moar is at v0.0.1. It works, but it's not perfect. I built this because I needed to understand my own repositories and the existing tools were either too complex or just ugly. It's a bit of a "grog brain developer" project, but it does what it says on the tin.

I've got a PRD for turning this into a SaaS because apparently people like paying for things they could just run locally. If that happens, expect more features, fancier charts, and maybe even some team collaboration stuff.

For now, it's free, open source, and waiting for you to find all the bugs I missed (I'm sure there are plenty).

## Feedback and contributions

As with all my projects, I'm basically the only user, so finding bugs is getting harder. If you find one, or have a feature idea, or just want to tell me my taste in chart colors is terrible (I know it is), hit up the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/git-report) and open an issue.

Pull requests welcome too, if you want to fix my terrible code or add something cool. Just... try not to break things too badly, yeah?

## What's in a name?

"git-moar" is because it's git, but with MORE. More charts, more metrics, more stuff. Also I'm terrible at naming things.

Published as "git-report" on npm because... well, I forgot to check if the name was taken. Oops. So `npm install git-report` will get you git-moar. I know, I know, it's confusing. We live with our mistakes.

## Closing thoughts

Thanks for reading this far. Hope you find git-moar useful (or at least mildly entertaining). Even if you don't use it, maybe looking at your git history in a different way will give you some insights. Or at least some amusing graphs to share at the next team meeting.

Go forth, analyze your repos, and may your bus factor never be 1!

Alors, qui ici utilise **git** ? Et j'entends *vraiment* l'utiliser, pas juste `commit -m "truc"` et pousser quand ça casse ?

Oui, git c'est génial et tout, mais parfois vous regardez `git log` et c'est comme essayer de lire le code Matrix à l'envers. Il y a tellement de données là-dedans. Tellement de patterns. Tellement de... questions ! Genre "qui a cassé la prod le mois dernier ?" ou "c'est un projet à one-man show ?" ou "pourquoi ce fichier a plus de commits que tout mon historique de projet ?"

Bref, j'en ai eu marre de fixer des hashes de commit, alors j'ai créé **git-moar** ! 😛

## C'est quoi git-moar ?

[git-moar](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/git-report) est un outil CLI qui prend votre dépôt git (ou dépôts, si vous vous sentez aventureux) et le transforme en un magnifique rapport HTML interactif avec des graphiques, des métriques et des insights qui pourraient bien vous faire remettre en question vos choix de vie (en bien... je crois).

Deux commandes principales :
* **`snitch`** — analyse un seul dépôt (top pour du stalking... je veux dire, comprendre... un projet spécifique)
* **`scattered`** — analyse plusieurs dépôts en une fois (parfait pour ce moment "oh mon dieu, qu'est-ce qu'on a créé")

Imaginez git log, mais avec de vraies couleurs, des graphiques, et des données que vous pouvez montrer au management sans qu'ils s'endorment. Pas state of the art, mais ça bat quand même `grep` ! 😊

## Démarrage rapide

```bash
npm install -g git-moar

cd mon-projet
git-moar snitch

# ou analysez plusieurs dépôts en une fois (les wildcards fonctionnent, magie oblige)
git-moar scattered ~/projets/*/

open git-moar-report.html  # ou xdg-open sur Linux, ou start sur Windows
```

## Qu'est-ce qu'il y a dans le rapport ?

Ah, la partie intéressante ! 15+ types de graphiques et plus de métriques que vous ne pouvez en secouer une branche.

### Métriques de qualité (parce qu'on fait semblant de s'en soucier)

* **Bus Factor** — combien de personnes doivent se faire écraser par un bus avant que votre projet meure ? Spoiler: probablement 1 pour la plupart d'entre nous
* **Code Churn** — lignes ajoutées vs supprimées, avec une répartition "qui supprime vraiment du code"
* **Health Score** — un chiffre pour vous sentir bien ou terrible
* **Coefficient de Gini** — inégalité des contributions, parce que l'économie peut tout ruiner

### Insights de productivité (pour prouver que vous ne glandez pas)

* **Heures de pointe** — vous commitez quand ? 3h du mat en mode café-fuel ou 9h-17h en mode esclavage corporate ?
* **Vélocité** — commits dans le temps, avec tendances et la chute inévitable "qu'est-ce qui s'est passé en décembre"
* **Équilibre vie pro/vie perso** — commits weekend vs semaine (préparez-vous à être jugé)

### Points chauds de fichiers ( les drama queens de votre dépôt)

* **Fichiers souvent modifiés** — des fichiers touchés plus souvent que votre téléphone
* **Silos de connaissance** — des fichiers qu'une seule personne touche jamais (recette pour le désastre)

### Autres trucs cools

* **Classification des commits** — vous écrivez des features, des fixes, de la doc, ou juste "update" ?
* **Scoring de qualité des messages** — vos messages de commit sont terribles comment ? (spoiler: probablement très)
* **Calendrier de contributions style GitHub** — montrez vos petits carrés verts (ou leur absence)
* **Tableaux de données triables** — filtrez et triez contributeurs, fichiers, commits, peu importe

## Visualisations

Le rapport utilise [Chart.js 4.4.0](https://www.chartjs.org/) pour tous les jolis graphiques, et laissez-moi vous dire, j'étais plutôt fier quand j'ai réussi les heatmaps. Voici ce que vous obtenez :

* Tendances d'activité dans le temps
* Graphiques de distribution des contributeurs
* Heatmaps de commits (horaire, quotidien, hebdomadaire)
* Patterns de modifications de fichiers
* Graphiques de code churn
* Et comme 10 autres trucs que j'ai oubliés parce qu'y en a trop

Thèmes sombre/clair aussi, parce que je suis pas un monstre qui vous force à fixer des écrans blancs à 2h du mat.

## Fonctionnalités avancées

### Templates (pour les control freaks)

Vous n'aimez pas mon magnifique rapport (lire: à peine fonctionnel) par défaut ? Créez vos propres templates. C'est un peu d'HTML avec des variables de template, et si vous cassez tout, bah... c'est vos oignons. J'ai fourni le template par défaut comme point de départ, mais vous pouvez faire ce que vous voulez.

### Options d'export

Parfois vous avez besoin de données pour des tableurs (ou ce boss qui exige des fichiers CSV pour je ne sais quelle raison). git-moar peut exporter en :

* **CSV** — parce qu'Excel règne toujours en maître dans le monde corporate apparemment
* **JSON** — pour quand vous voulez parser des trucs programmatiquement ou le balancer à une IA qui vous dit que votre dépôt est foutu

### Analyse multi-dépôts

La commande `scattered` est là où ça devient intéressant. Analysez plusieurs dépôts et obtenez des insights cross-projets. Vous voulez savoir quel dépôt a le plus de commits dans tout votre org ? Quels contributeurs s'étalent trop ? Qui ne commit rien nulle part ? (je te regarde, Dave).

Supporte les wildcards :

```bash
git-moar scattered ~/projets/*/
git-moar scattered ~/projets/git-*/
git-moar scattered ~/projets/*-backend/ ~/projets/*-frontend/
```

## Stack technique (trucs de nerds)

Construit avec :
* **Node.js** — parce que je suis trop paresseux pour apprendre Rust (traitez-moi)
* **Chart.js 4.4.0** — pour les graphiques, évidemment
* **Simple-Datatables** — pour les tableaux triables
* **Chalk** — pour la sortie colorée dans le terminal (la vie est trop courte pour le monochrome)
* **SLOC** — pour compter les lignes de code

En CLI. Pas de serveurs. Pas de cloud. Pas d'abonnements. Juste lancez et obtenez votre rapport. Privacy-focused par design (les données ne quittent jamais votre machine).

## Et maintenant ?

### Installer

```bash
npm install -g git-moar
```

Ou clonez et construisez si vous êtes de ceux qui ne font pas confiance à npm (je comprends).

### Lancer

```bash
# dépôt unique
git-moar snitch

# multi dépôt
git-moar scattered <chemin-vers-depots>/

# avec options (parce qu'y a toujours des options)
git-moar snitch --output mon-rapport.html --theme dark --since "2024-01-01"
```

Utilisez `git-moar snitch --help` ou `git-moar scattered --help` pour tous les flags. Pas mal, et j'ai probablement oublié d'en documenter certains, donc... bonne chance ?

### Partager

Le fichier HTML généré est autonome (graphiques intégrés et tout). Envoyez-le par mail, mettez-le sur un serveur, uploadez-le quelque part, peu importe. Juste un fichier. Pas de dépendances. Pas rien.

## La vérité brute

Regardez, git-moar est en v0.0.1. Ça marche, mais c'est pas parfait. J'ai créé ça parce que j'avais besoin de comprendre mes propres dépôts et les outils existants étaient soit trop complexes soit juste moches. C'est un peu un projet "dev au cerveau lissé", mais ça fait ce qui est écrit sur l'étiquette.

J'ai un PRD pour en faire un SaaS parce qu'apparemment les gens aiment payer pour des trucs qu'ils pourraient juste lancer en local. Si ça arrive, attendez-vous à plus de features, des graphiques plus fancy, et peut-être même des trucs de collaboration en équipe.

Pour l'instant, c'est gratuit, open source, et attend que vous trouviez tous les bugs que j'ai manqués (je suis sûr qu'il y en a plein).

## Feedback et contributions

Comme pour tous mes projets, je suis基本上 le seul utilisateur, donc trouver des bugs devient plus dur. Si vous en trouvez un, ou avez une idée de feature, ou juste voulez me dire que mon goût en couleurs de graphiques est terrible (je le sais), allez sur le [dépôt GitHub](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/git-report) et ouvrez une issue.

Les pull requests sont bienvenues aussi, si vous voulez corriger mon code terrible ou ajouter un truc cool. Juste... essayez pas de tout casser trop badly, OK ?

## C'est quoi un nom ?

"git-moar" c'est parce que c'est git, mais avec PLUS. Plus de graphiques, plus de métriques, plus de trucs. Aussi je suis nul pour nommer les choses.

Publié comme "git-report" sur npm parce que... bah, j'ai oublié de vérifier si le nom était pris. Oups. Donc `npm install git-report` vous donnera git-moar. Je sais, je sais, c'est confus. On vit avec nos erreurs.

## Pensées de fin

Merci d'avoir lu jusqu'ici. J'espère que vous trouverez git-moar utile (ou au moins moyennement divertissant). Même si vous ne l'utilisez pas, peut-être que regarder votre historique git d'une manière différente vous donnera quelques insights. Ou au moins quelques graphiques amusants à partager à la prochaine réunion d'équipe.

Allez, analysez vos dépôts, et que votre bus factor ne soit jamais 1 !

{{% goodbye %}}
15:T5c6,
You can now use a "namespace" for options.

It will create an associative array with passed keys and values !

## Usage

These are the arguments for the `nested` sub command :

```bash
arg-name: nested option namespace
description: positional argument description
--one-of <one-of>: accepted values for keys, repeatable
--complete <complete>: bash built-in completely function, repeatable
--complete-custom <complete-custom>: completely custom dynamic suggestion, repeatable
```

This is how to generate (or add using `parse` !) a script using it:

```bash
parseArger generate --output my-script --nested 'opt-ns "a nested option"';
```

And this is how to use said script:

```bash
./my-script --opt-ns-a "value" --opt-ns-b "b value" --opt-ns-option "my opt" --opt-ns-blabla "lorem ispum";
```

The nested value are in an associative array as follow :

```bash
echo _arg_opt_ns["a"];
# value
echo _arg_opt_ns["b"];
# b value
echo _arg_opt_ns["option"];
# my opt
echo _arg_opt_ns["blabla"];
# lorem ispum
```

## To do what ?

Sometimes when scripting, you are using other CLI programs.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to pass specific option to that programs, from the CLI, you know, to make your scripts more extensible/user friendly !

## What now ?

I'm heading back to unit test land, so you do you my lil' friend ;)

I just realized I didn't not document the `nested` options, so I just came to do that !

16:Tf96,
I have been toying around with RPIs for years, got a original Model A with a whopping 512MB of ram and the (slooooow) 700Mhz single core cpu. It served me (and my flatmate then) well as a media center for a couple years, then I moved around a bunch and when I settled back (years after), it was time for the RPI 4.

## What do I have

That is what I have right now, a 4 . I considered an 8 GB model, but considering my use case, I'd probably run out of punch before filling the 8 gigs of ram.

It boots off of a usb ssd and has 2 external (NTFS...) drives connected. I also have a DaC pro 2 from hifiberry and it displays out of a cheapo generic 1080p projector I bought from the jungle site on my wall. Yes, it is fine. I watch the occasional DVD so it is fine. I sure would like better but, meh, no coins for that.

## Coming soon hardware

A PI 5 8 gigs should be here before december. It will replace the pi 4 for all on premise stuff. The bump in power justify the 8 GB in my opinion, and with that bump will come a few more software that I will run.

## More powa', more softwa'

I'll have that for sure, we'll see how the pi behaves with this kind of load.

### A git server

This is not the place to explain why I'm starting to be kind of careful with Github, but I am.

So just as a precaution, I will run a git server thing on the updated homelab, you'll have to wait for the article to know which one ;).

### CD stuff

I'd like to  (re-)dip a toe in continuous delivery stuff. It'd help keep my StationIO deployement up to date, build this site automagically, handle recurring task on my (way too) many projects, do whatever, the sky is your oyster (or something) !

If I could eliminate as much sysadmin as possible, hell I'd love that !

### A personal cloud thingy

I didn't pick one yet but OwnCloud, NextCloud, whatever. I might try a bunch and make content about that ^^.

I'd like to be able to simply store/backup documents, access them from outside sometimes, I want a REST api and easy external sync for back up that's pretty much it.

Bonus points for apps (photo management, document edition, etc...) and plugins, but not necessary.

## A door to the world

"Soon"(tm), I should have a fiber connection and should have athe perks thats comes with that,
* a static(ish) IP
* bandwith
* more bandwith

This means, I'll be able to open some of my services to the world. 

I want a PiHole, a VPN and use it as a relay for my weather stations, git server and the cloud thingy to be able to acces them from outside.

In the mean time, my sister's kids are getting older. They just got their first decent computer and start to venture online and I would like to keep them safe, I'll probably end up routing all traffic through me (VPN) with drastic mesure (the great wall of Didi)

Maybe I'll install a few FOSS for social media and communication needs to use with their friends as instagram, FB, X or whatever ARE NOT allowed for now.
Kids are mean and parents are dumb (and/or inverselly proportional), so, yeah, I'm a fascist (the great wall and stuff ^^), whatever you'd like, yeah, they'll probably suffer from something else, but at least, not that.

## MyPi, a toolbox for my raspberry by homelab

Of course, I created a [project](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/MyPi) for that.

TLDR is I want to automate install and maintainance on my Pi, I could have used Ansible or something but I wanted to do it myself using Bash as much as possible.

Nothing fancy for now:
* install/update software using apt, docker and git
* add entry to the fstab
* add entry to the nfs exports
* create folders
* get metrics about the pi (temperature, ram, etc...)

## What now ?

You can expect a bunch of articles about [MyPi](/projects/mypi), the different software I'll use, how I'll use them, scripts creation to make life easier. More random content probably, haven't decided yet.

Definitly some sort of avant calendar (not daily) regarding homelab creation.

{{% goodbye %}}
17:T231b,
A small article on an mdd update, and the process behind it. Nothing fancy, but a little bit of food for thoughts ;).

## Why is this even a post

First of all, I'm trying to make content ! And, also, I almost went at it "the wrong way", so I thought it would be a good idea to share my experience.

Now, if you never put your foot in your mouth when doing something, you should pass on the read, otherwise, you might find something interesting or at least feel less lonely.

It's on a very small scale and that is why I think it is such a good example. On top of which, you already are familiar with the project so you won't be lost, and also, it's a tutorial project...i'm gonna milk it !

## TLDR

I wanted to go at it fancy, separation between stuff and all, but I ended up doing it the simple way, and it's fine. At least for now.

Yes, it would have worked otherwise, it would have been fine or even great, prepared for improvement and shit, but, a mix of "meh, can't be bothered" and, "hum, i certainly don't need that now..." got the better of the fancyness.

Let's see how it all happened.

## Heads first

* "I should create entry for my projects on the site....huuuuuu, booooorrriiiing...."
* "well, you have a tool for that big dumb dumb" (yes, we are talking to myself, no judgement !)
* "oooh yeah, hum... but it creates article only..."
* "dude, decouple your thumbs from Uranus !"
* "huuuuuu.....OOOOO KKAAAYYY...."

```bash
parseArger generate \
  --output bin/category \
  --help-message "create a new category" \
  --pos 'title "category title"' \
  --opt 'folder "article folder name" --alias directory --alias dir' \
  --opt 'categories "article parent categories" --short c --repeat --alias cat --alias parent' \
  --opt 'date "publication date meta" --short d --alias publication --alias publish-at' \
  --opt 'summary "summary meta" --short s --alias description --alias desc' \
  --nested 'meta "add any meta you want"'
```

And then take that from `article`, and that, oh, and that, and....

## Heeeyy, wait a minute, AKA duh

So, all I did for the last 37 seconds (damn, [parseArger](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger) is SOOOO coool !) is copy pasting article to make a simpler version of it.

Because, when you think about it, categories in Hugo are just articles, but instead onf a `index.md` file, you have a `_index.md`, maybe, just maybe, we could add an option to specify the file name, it would even make `mdd article` more versatile.

To make things a bit more user friendly (yes, you can have friendly CLI !), we'll also add a flag to say it's a category so you don't have to write `--filename _index.md` every time.

```bash
parseArger parse bin/article -i \
  --opt 'filename "markdown file name" --default-value index.md' \
  --flag 'is-category "this is a category, using _index.md as filename" --alias is-cat'
```

Let's modify our `bin/article file to reflect the new constraints.

```bash
# the end of the file 
if [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ] && [ -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then 
  rm "${_container_dir}/index.md" -f; 
fi
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then
	if [ "$_arg_template" == "" ] || [ ! -f "$_arg_template" ]; then
		if [ "$_arg_template" != "" ]; then
			log "template $_arg_template not found" -1;
		fi
		log "using default template" 4;
		_arg_template="${_SCRIPT_DIR}/../templates/article.md";
	fi
	sed \
		-e "s/{{metas}}/$_metas_str/g" \
		-e "s/{{content}}/$_contents_str/g" \
		"$_arg_template" > "${_container_dir}/index.md";
else
	die "file already exists: ${_container_dir}";
fi

# is now 
# if is-category and filename not specified
if [ "$_arg_is_category" == "on" ] && [ "$_arg_filename" == "index.md" ]; then
	_arg_filename="_index.md";
fi

# using _arg_filename instead of index.md
if [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ] && [ -f "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}" ]; then 
  rm "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}" -f; 
fi
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}" ]; then
	if [ "$_arg_template" == "" ] || [ ! -f "$_arg_template" ]; then
		if [ "$_arg_template" != "" ]; then
			log "template $_arg_template not found" -1;
		fi
		log "using default template" 4;
		_arg_template="${_SCRIPT_DIR}/../templates/article.md";
	fi
	sed \
		-e "s/{{metas}}/$_metas_str/g" \
		-e "s/{{content}}/$_contents_str/g" \
		"$_arg_template" > "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}";
else
	die "file already exists: ${_container_dir}";
fi

```

That simple, not even 10 lines (6, 6 lines, I counted them on re-read....dawn you braiiiin) ! Definitly worth it if you consider the alternative would have been a new file, with mostly duplicated code.

I could have called `mdd article` in my new command and then renamed `index.md` to `_index.md`, but it did not seem like a great solution to add 500 lines of code and another file for 10 lines of functionality, when i could add 10 (6 I said ! and most of it is modification) more lines and do more.

## Bug fixes and chores

Well, let's test our new toy, shall we ?

```bash
mdd article mdd --cat Projects --is-category \
  --summary "My MarkDown tools, a parseArger tutorial project"
```

Directory and file created ok, let's add an article then.

```bash
mdd article "Story of a simple update" \
  --summary "No plans survive first contact, the best part is no part, check yo' stagin'\!" \
  --h2 "Why is this even a post" \
  --h2 "TLDR" \
  --h2 "Heads first" \
  --h2 "Heeeyy, wait a minute, AKA 'duh'" \
  --h2 "Conclusion" \
  --h2 "What now ?" \
  --cat Projects \
  --cat mdd \
  --tag parseArger \
  --tag mdd \
  --tag devlog \
  --tag bash \
  --tag tutorial
```

aaannnnnd `ERROR 2023/11/05 10:46:34 Rebuild failed: "/src/content/Projects/mdd/Story of a simple update/index.md:4:1": failed to unmarshal YAML: yaml: line 4: found character that cannot start any token`, NOOOPE !

A few minutes of head scratching, couple of copy paste and test and, yup, YAML do not like `\t` for arrays, it wants `  `... fine, what...eeeever.

```bash
if [ "${#_arg_tags[@]}" -gt 0  ]; then
	log "${#_arg_tags[@]} tags specified:" 4;
	_metas_str+="tags: \n";
	for _tg in "${_arg_tags[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tg" 4;
		_metas_str+="\t- $_tg\n";
	done
fi

# is now this
if [ "${#_arg_tags[@]}" -gt 0  ]; then
	log "${#_arg_tags[@]} tags specified:" 4;
	_metas_str+="tags: \n";
	for _tg in "${_arg_tags[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tg" 4;
    # RIGHT HERE, YOOOHOO
		_metas_str+="  - $_tg\n";
	done
fi
```

Aaaand, ....,  it does not crash anymore \o/.

Maybe `article` for the command is not as good now, let's change it to `new` we have to regenerate doc and completion anyway.

```bash
mv bin/article bin/new
rm -f bin/category
```

Edit mdd and modify parsearger declaration to remove `--one-of article`, it won't be remove automagically, even if bin-directory it's on purpose, I'll probably add a flag for this behavior later

```bash
# edit mdd replace
@parseArger pos target "mdd subcommand" --subcommand-directory "bin" --subcommand-run --subcommand-use-leftovers --subcommand --one-of "article" --one-of "new"
# with
@parseArger pos target "mdd subcommand" --subcommand-directory "bin" --subcommand-run --subcommand-use-leftovers --subcommand --one-of "new"
```

A bit of parsing magic before documentation and completion generation.

```bash
parseArger parse -i mdd

parseArger completely "mdd" ./mdd --subcommand-directory ./bin --no-run-completely > completely.yaml
completely preview > completely.bash

parseArger document --file ./mdd  --directory ./bin --title "MarkDown for Didi" > documentation.md

git add bin/new
git commit -am 'ename to new + category creation + tag bug fix'
git push origin main
```

It's now all ready to go \o/.

## Conclusion

Sometimes you don't need a bazooka to kill a fly, sometimes, you don't even need a gun (trust me, if I had access to guns, I'd use that to kill flies, of course I would !) and sometimes you don't even need to kill this fly... BUT not Today !

**heavy hand droping on the table**

Oh no, Today, we squashed the damn bugger by doing almost nothing !

Joking aside, I think that there's a place and time for complexity, but it was not it.

The main objective of this project is simplicity, and adding that much more surface area so early did seem to go against that.

If there is something I realized over the years, fancy don't always mean effective, whether it's a small joke project or a big gargantuous blob of a software and we as `engineers` have a small (tiny, little, puny, dare I say it, nanoscopic !) tendency to want to add complexity, `because`.

Just, be aware of it when you plan your next stuff, and this was a good example ;)

## What now ?

Nothing much, we had a look at updating a parseArger project and went over a bit of KISS principle. 
Maybe it made you realize you went overboard with some of your work ? Do you have a way of alleviating this kind of behavior ? And, do you even care or do you embrace complexity and overkill ?

18:T2f99,
## Let's create a project together !

I'm one of those `learn by doing` guys (mostly), I'm assuming your kind of are too, so let's build something together.

### A bit of context and basic requirements

For this blog, I'm using [hugo](https://gohugo.io) as a static site generator, and I'm writing my articles in markdown.
`hugo new` does the job, but I want something a bit different, with a folder that contains everything I need for the article (asset, code, etc...).
I would like my new post to be prefilled as much as possible so the tool should be able to set any meta.
Also, I tend to craft my article squeletton before writting (#trauma #school XD), so I should at least be able to add main headings from the CLI.
Because I do not know where this is goping, I won't just `generate` a script, I am going to start a new `project` so I can add more stuff later on.

## Leeeeeet's goooooo !

### Generate the project

We are using the `project` command, more information can be found in the [previous article]() if you need help.

```bash
# create a new project called mdd (MarkDown for Didi. Much creativity, such accronym, #wow)
# one subcommand 'article' for now.
parseArger project mdd \
  --description "markdown tools for my blog" \
  --git-repo "DimitriGilbert/mdd" \
  --project-subcommand article
```

This command will create a new folder `mdd` with the following structure:

```bash
|_ mdd
|_ documentation.md
|_ form.html
|_ Makefile
|_ readme.md
|_ bin
  |_ article
|_ utils
  |_ get_mdd
  |_ install
  |_ webserver 
```

Our entry point `mdd` should handle the command routing on its own, no work needed so we go along to `article`.

### Parse the article command

After some careful thoughts, I have refined my requirements which are now the following:

* create a new folder with the article name
  * if $(pwd) contains a `content` folder, create the article in it
  * article can have hierarchical categories. (if more than one, the previous is the parent)
    * categories make the path to the article
* create index.md from template you can specify
* tags, series, title, draft (on), date (now), summary metas handled by CLI
  * add any other meta you want
* add headings
  * headings level can be specified

From all that, we know that we'll need the folowing :
* arguments : 
  * title (the only thing mandatory, so it's an argument)
* options : 
  * categories (repeatable)
  * folder name (not strictly necessary, but i can forsee a need soooo...)
  * tags (repeatable)
  * series (repeatable)
  * date
  * summary
  * template
  * headings (repeatable)
  * headings level (default 2)
* flags :
  * draft (on by default)
* nested options :
  * meta
    * due to bash limitation, no repeatable nested options, so only the last value for a key will be kept

With that in mind, let's build our `parse` command to update our `bin/article` file. Don't forget to remove comment before executing, they don't play well with backslashes ^^.

```bash
# parse the bin/article file
parseArger parse bin/article \
  # add the title argument, nothing special here
  --pos 'title "article title"' \
  # add the folder name option, using title if none provided. I also declare aliases for this option, namely 'dir' and 'directory'
  --opt 'folder "article folder name" --alias directory --alias dir' \
  # add the categories option, repeatable, with aliases 'cat' and 'parent', a short version of the option is given, namely 'c'
  --opt 'categories "article parent categories" --short c --alias cat --alias parent --repeat' \
  # add the tags option, repeatable, with alias 'tag' and short option 't'
  --opt 'tags "article tags" --repeat --short t --alias tag' \
  # add the series option, with alias 'group' and short option 'g'
  --opt 'series "article belongs to this series" --alias group --short g' \
  # add the date option with short option 'd' and aliases 'publication', 'publish-at'
  --opt 'date "publication date meta" --alias publication --alias publish-at --short d' \
  # add the summary option with short option 's' and aliases 'description', 'desc'
  --opt 'summary "summary meta" --short s --alias description --alias desc' \
  # add the template option with short option 'tpl' and alias 'template'
  --opt 'template "template file to use" --alias tpl' \
  # add the headings option, repeatable, with short option 'h' and aliases 'part', 'h2'
  --opt 'headings "add headings to your file" --repeat --alias part --alias h2' \
  # add the headings level option with short option 'hl' and alias 'headings-level'
  --opt 'headings-level "heading level" --default-value 2 --alias hl' \
  # add the draft flag on by default and with a no-alias as publish 
  #   meaning if you want it off, you can either use --no-draft or --publish
  --flag 'draft "is it a draft" --on --no-alias publish' \
  # add the meta nested option
  --nested-options 'meta "add any meta you want"' \
  # parse in place, -i is the short option
  --in-place
```

This will give us the following `bin/article` file :

{{% fileContent file="/content/Projects/parseArger/My markdown tool, a parsearger project/article_v1" language="bash" %}}

It's a whole bunch of code, but mercyfully you do not have to pay attention to it \o/ (I mean, you can if you want, but it's not necessary).

Instead we are going to focus on the code that is going to use those parsed arguments and stuff !

### The (real) code

Well, let's start fullfilling our requirements !

#### Folder stuff

I use the log function with a level of 4 for comments ;)

```bash
# if nothing else, the title
_container_dir="$_arg_title";

if [ "$_arg_folder" != "" ]; then
	log "folder specified: $_arg_folder" 4;
	_container_dir="$_arg_folder";
fi

# there is categories at least 1
if [ "${#_arg_categories[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
	log "categories specified:" 4;
	_cat_dir="";
	for _cat in "${_arg_categories[@]}"; do
		_cat_dir+="$_cat/";
	done
	log "	categories path : $_cat_dir" 4;
	_container_dir="$_cat_dir$_container_dir";
fi

# hugo directory, it's a poor check , I don't care ^^
if [ -d "content" ]; then
	log "using content directory" 4;
	_container_dir="content/$_container_dir";
fi

# create the directory if it does not exist
if [ ! -d "$_container_dir" ]; then
	log "creating container directory: $_container_dir" 2;
	mkdir -p "$_container_dir";
fi
```

#### Meta stuff

Here we'll handle all the metas so that we can put that to rest.

```bash
# start with the title, it's always here
_metas_str="title: $_arg_title\n";

if [ "$_arg_date" != "" ]; then
	log "date specified: $_arg_date" 4;
	_metas_str+="date: $_arg_date\n";
fi

if [ "$_arg_summary" != "" ]; then
	log "summary specified: $_arg_summary" 4;
	_metas_str+="summary: $_arg_summary\n";
fi

if [ "${#_arg_tags[@]}" -gt 0  ]; then
	log "${#_arg_tags[@]} tags specified:" 4;
	_metas_str+="tags: \n";
	for _tg in "${_arg_tags[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tg" 4;
		_metas_str+="\t- $_tg\n";
	done
fi

if [ "$_arg_series" != "" ]; then
	log "series specified: $_arg_series" 4;
	_metas_str+="series: $_arg_series\n";
fi

if [ "$_arg_draft" == "on" ]; then
	log "draft on" 4;
	_metas_str+="draft: true\n";
fi

if [ "${#_arg_ns_meta[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
	log "other metas specified:" 4;
	for _tmp_k_meta in "${!_arg_ns_meta[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tmp_k_meta: ${_arg_ns_meta[$_tmp_k_meta]}" 4;
		_metas_str+="$_tmp_k_meta: ${_arg_ns_meta[$_tmp_k_meta]}\n";
	done
fi
```

#### Creating the headings

My article squeletton straight from the CLI

```bash
# empty content by default
_content_str="";
if [ "${#_arg_headings[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
	_hd_level_str="";
	for (( i=0; i<_arg_headings_level; i++ )); do
		_hd_level_str+="#";
	done

	log "headings specified:" 4;
	for _hd in "${_arg_headings[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_hd" 4;
		_contents_str+="\n$_hd_level_str $_hd\n\n\n";
	done
fi
```

#### Creating the index.md file

Creating the file itself, but, damn, even after *careful thoughts* it looks like I'm missing something....

We'll have to come back to that later i guess...

```bash

# dont erase stuff willy nilly, but, hum, looks like I'm missing something here...
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then
	if [ "$_arg_template" == "" ] || [ ! -f "$_arg_template" ]; then
		if [ "$_arg_template" != "" ]; then
			log "template $_arg_template not found" -1;
		fi
		log "using default template" 4;
		_arg_template="${_SCRIPT_DIR}/../templates/article.md";
	fi
	sed \
		-e "s/{{metas}}/$_metas_str/g" \
		-e "s/{{content}}/$_contents_str/g" \
		"$_arg_template" > "${_container_dir}/index.md";
else
	die "file already exists: ${_container_dir}";
fi
```

befor going any further, let's test what we have so far :

```bash
./mdd article "A test article" \
  --cat my-cat \
  --cat "sub category" \
  -s "this is just a test" \
  --folder "My test article" \
  --h2 "A title for my test" --h2 "a second part to the test" --h2 "Conclusion"
```

Executing this command gives us the following structure :

```bash
|_ my-cat
  |_ sub category
    |_ My test article
      |_ index.md
```

and `cat "my-cat/sub category/My test article/index.md"` :

```markdown
---
title: A test article
summary: this is just a test
draft: true

---

## A title for my test



## a second part to the test



## Conclusion
```

Well, looks like success to me !
Now let's get back to what we missed earlier !

#### Allow ovverride of index.md

Yeah, that's what we forgot, we need to be able to override the index.md file, so let's add a flag for that.

```bash
parseArger parse bin/article -i --flag 'force "erase if exists"'
```

This modify the parsing code so we just need to update the code accordingly :

this : 
```bash
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then
	...
```
becomes that :
```bash
if [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ] && [ -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then 
  rm "${_container_dir}/index.md" -f; 
fi
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ] || [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ]; then
	...
```

I do it this way if (when ?) we add a backup system ;)

### Nice to haves

Let"s take care of our QoL as developers and help our future selves, let's start with documentation.

```bash
parseArger document --file ./mdd  --directory ./bin --title "MarkDown for Didi" > documentation.md
```

I just pipe the result too the file, je suis un geudin, faut pas me chercher !

Completion is next, and as usual for me, something crashes, the "normal" command is as follow :

```bash
parseArger completely "mdd" ./mdd --subcommand-directory ./bin
```

which fails for me, but I use this workaround :

```bash
parseArger completely "mdd" ./mdd --subcommand-directory ./bin --no-run-completely > completely.yaml
completely preview > completely.bash
```

Why does this work when otherwise fail ? `\_(ツ)_/`

That done, the rc file require creation, this is the content :

```bash
if [ "${MDD_DIR}" != "" ]; then
  alias mdd="${MDD_DIR}/mdd";
  [ -f "${MDD_DIR}/completely.bash" ] && source "${MDD_DIR}/completely.bash";
fi
```

A small detour by the readme file to fill a bit of information :

```markdown
# Markdown for Didi

Markdown tools for my blog.
This is a tutorial project for [parseArger](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger).
```

### Tidy up !

I'll remove the form and the makefile, I don't need them for this project.
And if I end up doing, their just a command away ^^

```bash
rm -f form.html Makefile
```

If you followed along you might have extra directory from your test, don't forget to clean them !
And we're just left with a commit to be done for now !

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
# hub create <repo>
git push origin main
```

## What now ?

I won't re write a heroic fantasy introduction in lieu of conclusion this time, but for real, I kinda have nothing more to teach you on parseArger for now.

As for `mdd`, I'll probably add some stuff to it, but I don't know what yet, so I'll just leave it there for now. [bug report, feature request and PR](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/mdd) are welcome though, I don't promise quick support but I'll sure have a look ;)

I'll probably go over a few other stuff I created before writting again about parseArger, but it'll be back, I promise !

{{% projectInteraction project="parseArger" %}}

{{% goodbye %}}
19:T2c26,
Now that you can [generate and parse](/projects/parsearger/generate-and-parse/) scripts with [fine tuned arguments, options and flags](/projects/parsearger/more-on-pos-opt-and-flag/), we are going to genrate supporting stuff for our scripts.

## Completion

Completion is a great feature of the terminal that allows you to complete commands, options and arguments by pressing the `tab` key. It is a great way to avoid typos and to discover new commands and options. For me, it is the main selling point on why you should use the terminal.
I use [completely](https://github.com/DannyBen/completely), so  you have to install it before generating the completion script, but the script itself is standalone. 
Here comes the help :

```bash
  command-name: command-name
  file: file
  --subcommand-directory|--subcmd-dir <subcommand-directory>: directory for subcommand target
  --completely-cmd|--cmpcmd <completely-cmd>: completely command, repeatable
  --extra-file <extra-file>: extra yaml declaration, repeatable
  --yaml-file <yaml-file>: yaml file name [default: ' completely.yaml ']
  --completion-file <completion-file>: completion file name [default: ' completely.bash ']
  --run-completely|--no-run-completely: run completely, on by default (use --no-run-completely to turn it off)
          no-aliases: --no-run,
  --discover-subcommand|--no-discover-subcommand: auto run completely on found subcommand
```

Let's have a look a few examples :

```bash
# generate completion for my-script
parseArger completely my-script "./my-script"

# generate completion for my-script and its subcommand in the ./bin directory
parseArger completely my-script "./my-script" --subcommand-directory "./bin"
```

Sometimes, for some esotheric reason, it does not work, but I found a work around :

```bash
# generate completion definition for completely
parseArger completely my-script "./my-script" --no-run-completely > completely.yaml
# run completely preview (that does work) and put the output in the completion script file
completely preview > completely.bash
```

### command-name

The command you generate the completion for

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script
```

### file

The executable file for `command-name`

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script
```

### --subcommand-directory

If your command has subcommands, you can specify the directory where they are located so it will generate the completion as well.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --subcommand-directory ./bin
```

### --completely-cmd

Completely is not installed inyour path ? It runs as a container ? That's ok, you can specify the command to run completely.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --completely-cmd "docker run --rm -it completely"
```

### --extra-file

The completion is generated from the arguments options and flags you defined in your script, but you can concatenate other yaml files to add more completion.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --extra-file ./my-script.completion.yaml
```

### --yaml-file

If the yaml file name does not suit you.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --yaml-file ./not-completely.yaml
```

### --completion-file

Same as for the yaml file.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --completion-file ./not-completely.bash
```

### --[no-]run-completely

Output the yaml file to stdout

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --no-run-completely
```

### --[no-]discover-subcommand

If you have subcommands, you can generate the completion for them as well, but you don't have to.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --no-discover-subcommand
```

## Documentation

making things is coll, but making so that others (or you, after a while) can use whatever you put out there is even cooler. But it is also very long and boring. So I made a tool to do some of it for me. I don't use the output as is but it's a good starting point ;).

```bash
  -f, --file <file>: file to document, repeatable
  -d, --directory|--folder <directory>: directory to document, repeatable
  -o, --out <out>: output file
  --tag <tag>: markdown tag for title [default: ' ## ']
  --next-tag-prepend <next-tag-prepend>: prepend to next title tag level [default: ' # ']
  --title <title>: documentation title [default: ' Usage ']
  --title-tag <title-tag>: documentation title tag [default: ' # ']
  --sub-directory|--no-sub-directory: document subdirectory, on by default (use --no-sub-directory to turn it off)
  --append-output|--no-append-output: add to output file if it exists, on by default (use --no-append-output to turn it off)
```

and a few examples :

```bash
# generate completion for my-script
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --out "./my-script documentation.md"

# generate completion for my-script and all the scripts in the ./bin directory, erase "my-script documentatino.md" if it exists
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --directory "./bin" --out "./my-script documentation.md" --no-append-output
```

### --file

Document this file, repeatable. First in first out.

```bash
# generate completion for my-script and my-other-script
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --file "./my-other-script"
```

### --directory

Document all parseArger scripts in this directory, repeatable. First in first out.

```bash
# generate completion for all the scripts in the ./bin and ./I/put/stuff/every/where directories
parseArger document --directory "./bin" --directory "./I/put/stuff/every/where"
```

### --out

If not specified, I will barf all over stdout !

```bash
# generate completion output to stdout
parseArger document --file "./my-script"
# generate completion output to documentation.md
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --out "./documentation.md"
```

### --tag

I shall use a tag for titles, default is ` ## `. But you know, if youd rather have h6, you can do that.

```bash
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --tag "######"
```

### --next-tag-prepend

I start taggin with --tag value, but for each subsequent title, I prepend this value to the tag. Default is ` # `.

```bash
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --next-tag-prepend "######"
```

### --title

If you wanna get fancy with your title, otherwise you'll get a boring ` Usage `.

```bash
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --title "How to use my script"
```

### --title-tag

I already have an h1  bladi bladi blada, whatever ...!

```bash
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --title-tag "###"
```

### --[no-]sub-directory

If you ain't tellin' me, I'll go though your stuff !

```bash
parseArger document --directory "./bin" --no-sub-directory
```

### --[no-]append-output

That is usually how I clean, using a black hole !

```bash
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --out "./documentation.md" --no-append-output
```

## HTML form

Wait, what ?!! Why would a bash CLI script need a form ? Well, it doesn't, but I had the idea of using them for documentation purposes.
They come bundled with some (very dirty) javascript to generate a command from the input so less terminally inclined people can take advantage of your tools too (and maybe, just maybe learn to appreciate it ;) ).

```bash
  file: file to process
  --command <command>: command string, default to file 
  --action <action>: form action
  --form-class <form-class>: form html class
  --input-container-class <input-container-class>: input container class [default: ' form-group ']
  --input-class <input-class>: input class [default: ' form-control ']
  --label-class <label-class>: label class [default: ' form-label ']
  --select-class <select-class>: select class [default: ' form-select ']
  --checkbox-container-class|--radio-container-class <checkbox-container-class>: checkbox and radio class [default: ' form-check ']
  --checkbox-class|--radio-class <checkbox-class>: checkbox and radio class [default: ' form-check-input ']
  --checkbox-label-class|--radio-label-class <checkbox-label-class>: checkbox and radio label class [default: ' form-check-label ']
  --parent-form <parent-form>: parent form for result
  --form|--no-form: display form, on by default (use --no-form to turn it off)
  --button|--no-button: display button, on by default (use --no-button to turn it off)
  --js|--no-js: create javascript, --no-js forces --no-result, on by default (use --no-js to turn it off)
  --result|--no-result: display result, on by default (use --no-result to turn it off)
```

## file

A simple form for a simple file.

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script

```

## --command

If your filename do not match the command you want to run (for alias reasons), you can specify it here.

```bash
# when you do not want to keep things simple
parseArger html-form my-script --command "my-script-alias"

```

## --action

The form does not go anywhere by default, but you can change that !

```bash
# Where I want to go
parseArger html-form my-script --action "/over/the/rainbow"

```

## --form-class

The form uses bootstrap classes by default so it's easy and quick to make them pretty.
I won't repeat it, but it goes for all *-class options.

```bash
# Me no like bootstrap !
parseArger html-form my-script --form-class "my-form-class"

```

## --input-container-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --input-container-class "my-input-container-class"

```

## --input-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --input-class "my-input-class"

```

## --label-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --label-class "my-label-class"

```

## --select-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --select-class "my-select-class"

```

## --checkbox-container-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script  --checkbox-container-class "my-checkbox-container-class"

```

## --checkbox-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --checkbox-class "my-checkbox-class"

```

## --checkbox-label-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --checkbox-label-class "my-checkbox-label-class"

```

## --parent-form

When you have sub commands, forms nest into one-another. You can specify the parent form id here.

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --parent-form "my-parent-form"

```

## --form

Then main form id

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --form "my-form"

```

## --[no-]button

On by default, --no- to not create a button

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --no-button

```

## --[no-]js

On by default, --no- to not create javascript

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --no-js

```

## --[no-]result

On by default, --no- to not show results

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --no-result

```

## What now ?

Completion scripts and documentions are a waiting ! You can now **more than ever** make your bash tools **even more awesome** (or useful, but who cares about that, uh ? ;) ) ! And if you get so inclined as create a GUI for your script, you have a starting point with the html form (I never said it was a good one ^^).
As always bugs and suggestions should go on [parseArger's github repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger).

Thanks for the read and I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D )

See you around and happy coding !
1a:T1f39,
Now that you know the basic of parseArger `generate` and `parse`, it's time to have a look at how we declare arguments, options and flags !

## --pos

Positional arguments are what most of us use in a bash script with `$1`, `$2`, `$...`
Well same thing here, but they have names And much more :

```bash
arg-name: positional argument name
description: positional argument description
--one-of <one-of>: accepted values, repeatable
--complete <complete>: bash built-in completely function, repeatable
--complete-custom <complete-custom>: completely custom dynamic suggestion, repeatable
--subcommand-directory <subcommand-directory>: directory containing subcommands, force subcommand, list parseArger script in directory to fill --one-of
--subcommand-variable <subcommand-variable>: array variable containing subcommand parts, force subcommand [default: ' __subcommand ']
--subcommand|--no-subcommand: is a subcommand
--subcommand-run|--no-subcommand-run: run subcommand, forces sub command
--subcommand-use-leftovers|--no-subcommand-use-leftovers: add leftover arguments to subcommand, forces subcommand
```

And a dumb example that generates a script that take one argument my-cmd and execute it as a subcommand using the leftover arguments, my-cmd must be one of "ls", "cd" or "cat" :
```bash
parseArger generate --pos \
  'my-cmd "an argument" --subcommand --subcommand-run --subcommand-use-leftovers --one-of ls --one-of cd --one-of cat'
```

### arg-name

The argument name, `-` will be replaced with `_` and the variable will be prefixed with `_arg_`.
So --my-super-argument value is assigned to $_arg_my_super_argument.

### description

Simple description for help, documentation and so on

### --one-of

Repeatable, The argument value must be one of, the most basic input validation, yeah !

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "my argument description" --one-of value1 --one-of value2'
```

### --complete

Repeatable, [Completely built-ins](https://github.com/DannyBen/completely#suggesting-files-directories-and-other-bash-built-ins).

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-file "this is a file path" --complete file'
```

### --complete-custom

Repeatable, [Completely custom](https://github.com/DannyBen/completely#suggesting-custom-dynamic-suggestions)

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is an argument" --complete-custom "\$(echo \"some_value some_other you_get the_point\")"'
```

### --subcommand-directory

You been a good kid and you did split your scripts ?
If they're all in the subcommand-directory, parseArger will add them to one of and build a __subcommand variable for you to use.
It forces --subcommand ... in case you were wondering.

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is an argument" --subcommand-directory bin'
```

### --subcommand-variable

Ooooh, oh you don't like __subcommand !!? What should it be called then ? It forces --subcommand.

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is an argument" --subcommand-variable notAsubCommand'
```

### --subcommand

This is a subcommand

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is a command argument" --subcommand'
```

### --subcommand-run

Run the subcommand before handing you the script, forces --subcommand.

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is an argument" --subcommand-run'
```

### --subcommand-use-leftovers

Maybe those leftovers are worth something..., after all ! Forces --subcommand

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is an argument" --subcommand-use-leftovers
```

## --opt

I'm pretty sure most of you were waiting for that : (add ethereal music here) options !

```bash
arg-name: positional argument name
description: positional argument description
--repeat-min <repeat-min>: minimum repeatition forces repeat [default: ' 1 ']
--repeat-max <repeat-max>: maximum repeatition forces repeat
--one-of <one-of>: accepted values, repeatable
-d, --default-value <default-value>: value, repeatable
-s, --short <short>: short form
--alias <alias>: option alias, repeatable
--empty-value <empty-value>: value for empty option
--complete <complete>: bash built-in completely function, repeatable
--complete-custom <complete-custom>: completely custom dynamic suggestion, repeatable
-r|--repeat|--no-repeat: repeatable
--empty|--no-empty: use option as flag
```

I won't bore you with arg-name and description, and if you need me too, you might want to re read the previous part a tiny tad more attentively, maybe, if you'd like to.

### --repeat-min

Repeatable option, yes ! but at least this many ! Forces --repeat.

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "this is an option" --repeat-min 42
```

### --repeat-max

Repeatable option, yes ! but not too much ! Forces --repeat.

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "this is an option" --repeat-max 69
```

### --one-of

see --pos --one-of above, it's the same ;)

### --default-value

An option, why not, but it shall not be empty !

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "musnt be eeeemmmmpty" --default-value "this is not empty"'
```

### --short

I know ya'll concerned about bodily efficiency (my mom called that "lazy"...), letters matters ! you got 26 of'em, that's how many options max my scripts have !

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "lazily call me" --short o'
```

### --alias

I know it's hard to always agree (especially with yourself !), with aliases, no more decision (about option names), you can have your cake, and eat it, too !

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'a-opt "lazily call me" --alias "an-opt" --alias "an-option" --alias "needlessly-long-option-name"'
```

### --short

I know ya'll concerned about bodily efficiency (my mom called that "lazy"...), letters matters ! you got 26 of'em, that's how many options max my scripts have !

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "lazily call me" --short o'
```

### --complete

see --pos --complete above, it's the same ;)

### --complete-custom

see --pos --complete-custom above, it's the same ;)

### --repeat

You can now have multiple values for your option. the option is now an array, even if only one value is given.

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "look ma', I'am an array !" --repeat'
```

### --empty

Option or flag ? Well, why not both ? A flag if you don't give it anything, an option otherwise ! 

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "option>flag superposition" --empty'
```

## --flag

Ahoy ! raise the flaaaaaag ! (I'd say I'm grasping at branches, but it seems tree do not grow in the ocean...)

```bash
arg-name: positional argument name
description: positional argument description
-s, --short <short>: short form
--no-name <no-name>: value for the negation
--alias <alias>: flag alias, repeatable
--no-alias <no-alias>: flag negation alias, repeatable
--on|--no-on: on by default
```

You know the drill with arg-name, description, --short and alias, it's up above ;)

### --no-name

`--no-<flag-name>` do not fly ? Fine, you choose !

```bash
parseArger generate --flag 'do-that "flabbergasted, flag a..." --no-name dont-do-that'
```

### --no-alias

There are plenty of ways to say no !

```bash
parseArger generate --flag 'do-that "flabbergasted, flag a..." --no-alias this-instead --no-alias do-this'
```

### --on

It's already on... but you can turn it off.

```bash
parseArger generate --flag 'do-that "flabbergasted, flag a..." --on'
```

## What now ?

Now you almost have the whole view on parseArger, enough for simple scripts anyway !
But maybe you do not value your mental health much and would like to create a whole program in bash ?
Well, What a coincidence, next time we'll have a look at the `project` command, it'll help you do just that ! (the program part, I do not deal in mental health)
As always bugs and suggestions should go on [parseArger's github repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger).

Thanks for the read and I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D )

See you around and happy coding !1b:T1d74,
We [previously](/projects/parsearger/create-bash-scripts-youll-want-to-use) had a quick look at [parseArger](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/parseArger/).
Let's focus on the generate and parse command today !
I tried to make my arguments descriptions fairly clear, but an example is always nice don't you think ?

## Generate

This command will generate (yeah I know, much creativity) a new bash script.
We'll have a look at them one by one but here are the whole lot of arguments, options and flags for the command. (yes, this is the output from --help ^^)

```bash
-p, --pos <pos>: positional argument declaration, repeatable
-o, --opt <opt>: optional arg declaration, repeatable
-f, --flag <flag>: flag declaration, repeatable
-s, --set <set>: declare var, repeatable
-l, --source <source>: file to source, repeatable
-m, --help-message <help-message>: help message for the command [default: ' I send an SOS to the world ']
--help-option <help-option>: help option trigger
--help-short-option <help-short-option>: short help option
--leftovers-name <leftovers-name>: extra arguments variable name [default: ' leftovers ']
--use-shebang <use-shebang>: shebang executable [default: ' /bin/bash ']
--set-version <set-version>: set version number
--version-opt-name <version-opt-name>: version option name [default: ' version ']
--version-short-option <version-short-option>: version short option name [default: ' v ']
--die-fn-name <die-fn-name>: die function name [default: ' die ']
--log-fn-name <log-fn-name>: log function name [default: ' log ']
--verbose-opt-name <verbose-opt-name>: verbose option name [default: ' verbose ']
--verbose-level <verbose-level>: default verbose level [default: ' 0 ']
--leftovers|--no-leftovers: accept extra arguments
--bang|--no-bang: include shebang, on by default (use --no-bang to turn it off)
--version-opt|--no-version-opt: generate version opt handling, on by default (use --no-version-opt to turn it off)
--use-verbose|--no-use-verbose: generate verbose level parser, on by default (use --no-use-verbose to turn it off)
--parse-leftovers|--no-parse-leftovers: parse leftovers, force leftover
```

Forget about --pos --opt and --flag, we are going over them in a different article.

### --set

repeatable, declare a variable at the top of the script.
It can use `$()` to run commands but be careful about escaping (which might cause trouble with parsing sometimes...)

```bash
parseArger generate --set 'my_var="my value"' \
  --set 'my_var_dynamic_var="\$(cat /a/file)"'
```

### --source

repeatable, source a file at the top of the script.

```bash
parseArger generate --source "/path/to/the/file"
```

### --help-message

the script help message. It might be a good idea to make it useful, but you don't have to... 3:-D

```bash
parseArger generate --help-message 'my script does something'
```

### --help-option

option used to trigger help, the fact that you can does not mean that you should.

```bash
parseArger generate --help-option 'not-very-helpful-help-opt'
```

### --help-short-option

short option help trigger

```bash
parseArger generate --help-short-option z
# because why not z ?
```

### --leftovers-name

extra argument array variable name. Forces --leftovers flag.

```bash
parseArger generate --leftovers-name "extra_args"
```

### --use-shebang

specify the shebang, the generated script does not change though, use at your own risk ;).
If you have cross shell compatibility tips and tricks, I am all ears !

```bash
parseArger generate --use-shebang "#!/bin/zsh"
```

### --set-version

give a version to the script, not enforcing any kind of whatever here, you can `--set-version "potato"`, i won't judge

```bash
parseArger generate --set-version "0.1-alpha-preview-48"
```

### --version-opt-name

version trigger option, `--version` by default, but if you hate conventions.

```bash
parseArger generate --version-opt-name revision
```

### --version-short-option

short option trigger for version

```bash
parseArger generate --version-short-option i
```

### --die-fn-name

who wouldn't choose how one dies ? Bar that, I'll let you choose how your script dies.

```bash
parseArger generate --die-fn-name wasted
```

### --log-fn-name

same as die, but I have nothing funny to add, so I think I am just rambling at this point, don't you think ?

```bash
parseArger generate --log-fn-name report
```

### --verbose-opt-name

.

```bash
parseArger generate --verbose-opt-name tmi
```

### --verbose-level

default verbose level for your script

```bash
parseArger generate --verbose-level 42
```

### --leftovers | --no-leftovers

do not waste ! Think about those poor scripts which do not have options.
So you pack all these nice extra arguments and options in an array for later ! And do not read from stdin before you finished it all !!

```bash
parseArger generate --leftovers
```

The array variable is `$_arg_leftovers` or `$_arg_<whatever you chose with --leftovers-name>`.

### --parse-leftovers | --no-parse-leftovers

Force --leftovers and if you hate unordered mess, you can parse the leftovers and look for option like syntax to be extracted in an associative array. How neat.

```bash
parseArger generate --parse-leftovers
```

The array variable is `$_arg_parsed_leftovers` or `$_arg_parsed_<whatever you chose with --leftovers-name>`.

### --bang | --no-bang

use a shebang, on by default

```bash
parseArger generate --no-bang
```

### --version-opt | --no-version-opt

versions are for looooooosers ! #mainOrDie

```bash
parseArger generate --no-version-opt
```

### --use-verbose | --no-use-verbose

when you have nothing to say anyway (or way too many, and you won't stop, and you know you should, but you won't...)

```bash
parseArger generate --no-use-verbose
```

## Parse

Whether it is because you forgot something, "oooh, i might be able to do that..." or "DO THAT !", requirements change, just generating the script is already nice but a way to update it would be nicer, like if we couuuuld... *parse* the script (...).
Like with `generate` command, the whole bunch of options and then details, if you don't find the documentation below, it's because it's the same as `generate`, so look up !

```bash
file: file to parse
-p, --pos <pos>: add positional argument declaration, repeatable
-o, --opt <opt>: add optional arg declaration, repeatable
-f, --flag <flag>: add flag declaration, repeatable
-s, --set <set>: add declare var, repeatable
-l, --source <source>: add file to source, repeatable
--set-version <set-version>: set version
-i|--inplace|--no-inplace: replace parseArger generated content in place
--leftovers|--no-leftovers: add leftovers
--parse-leftovers|--no-parse-leftovers: parse leftovers
```

### file

path to the file to parse, yes it is a positional argument, thank you for noticing the absence of `-`.
You are such an attentive reader :)

### --inplace

update the file directly, goes to stdout by default

## What now ?

Another article is coming to dive deeper in --pos, --opt and --flag options for both generate and parse so you can truly take full advantage of parseArger ;) ! 
But this has been most of my usage, barebones arguments, simple options (and a few flags, not often).
This is such a step up from bash scripts I created in the past, especially with the generated help !
What about you ? Would this help you or are you using other languages when "more complex" scripts are needed ?

Thanks for the read and I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D )

See you around and happy coding !
1c:T1dbe,
So, who here writes **bash** scripts ? And among these scripts, some take arguments, right ? 
Ok ok, so, get me any kind of documentation, usage hint or anything, like, right NOW !

Yeah...it's ok, we've all been there, and if you didn't, you might (not) have had a look at [parsing](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14203146){:target="_blank"} arguments and (AND!) [options](https://sookocheff.com/post/bash/parsing-bash-script-arguments-with-shopts/){:target="_blank"} in a bash script...it's a whole kerfuffle ! Well, "NO MORE !" I say !

## Meet parseArger

[ParseArger](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/parseArger/) is a bash program to generate standalone bash programs, at least :
* the argument and option parsing (hey, I'm not gonna take your job !),
* and a basic documentation (just the boring part),
* and an install script (...),
* and a bash completion script (...right ?),
* and an html form (whut ..?!)
* *aaaaand* a web server in bash (OH COOOOME ON !)(not really to be used apart from the time you can't do without... I'm just flexing ^^')

## TLDR

Oh, I know ya'll abunch of impatient nerds (at least I am...) so here is a quick run down to get going !

```bash
# download the install script
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger/main/utils/get_parseArger -O;
# make it executable
chmod +x get_parseArger;
# install, use --help for... help...
./get_parseArger --install;
# source bashrc, only needed once, modify according to your shell (if you don't know, it's the good one :D)
source "$HOME/.bashrc"

# generate a project
parseArger project my-awesome-project \
  --description "this is a cool project !" \
  # no commit, push or nothing, for install script generation
  --git-repo "myRandomDevName/my_awesome_project" \
  --project-subcommand my-script \
  --project-subcommand another-script

cd my-awesome-project
./my-awesome-project --help
```

## Install

First things first, let's install the damn thing ! 
Open up a terminal and execute those commands :
```bash
# download the install script
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger/main/utils/get_parseArger -O;
# You are thoughtfully encouraged to spend the next few minutes reading it, just to make sure I do not have nefarious purposes, thank you.

# make it executable
chmod +x get_parseArger;
# install
./get_parseArger --install;
# source bashrc, only needed once, modify according to your shell (if you don't know, it's the good one :D)
source "$HOME/.bashrc"

# check install
parseArger --help
```

More help is available on the install script, just type `./get_parseArger --help` in your terminal.

## Generate a script

Let's start simple with a script that has one argument, one option and one flag. We'll output the generated content to ./my-script.
```bash
parseArger generate \
  --help-message "this is a script" \
  --pos 'my-arg "my argument"' \
  --opt 'my-option "my option"' \
  --flag 'a-flag "boolean flag for my script"' \
  --output my-script
```

You are now free to add your actual code at the bottom of the generated file. It will not be modified if (when !) you update the parsing code using `parse`.
There are more options for --pos, --opt and --flag, I'll dive deeper into that in further articles ;).
Concerning variable created, `-` will be replaced with `_` and the variable will be prefixed with `_arg_`.
So --my-super-argument value is assigned to $_arg_my_super_argument

## Parse a script

Now that we have a script, needs have changed and we miss some options... Let's fix that then !
```bash
# -i (or --in-place) means that we update the file with the newly generated parsing code, keeping your custom code
parseArger parse ./my-script -i \
  --opt 'missing-option "my missing option"' \
  --opt 'another-opt "yet another one"'
```

Done, you you make the code that uses them :).

## Completion script

The best thing about the terminal ? completion ! 
You can't get your mouse on the most likely button you'll need to click in a window (erf, maybe, but ...the usability...).
Well, you can in a terminal :D. Creating the scripts manually though ? Gee..., no !

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script

source ./completely.bash
```

Remember you'll have to source the completion script to access completion in the terminal, you can add `source /path/to/my-script/completion.bash` to your .bashrc (or .zshrc and so on)

You will need [completely](https://github.com/DannyBen/completely) installed for the generation to work, but once generated it's standalone.

Sometimes, things here do not work as expected and I can't figure out why, if it does for you to, use this as a workaround

```bash
# do not run completely
parseArger completely my-script \
  ./my-script \
  --no-run-completely > completely.yaml

# use the completely preview and pipe to a file...
completely preview > completely.bash
```

## Documentation

We all have that pesky collegue that never remember how to use the oh so fantastic tools that you create (AKA you in 6 months).
Let's think about that guy a bit and throw him a bone with some documentation !

```bash
parseArger document ./my-script --out documentation.md
```

It's not perfect as it is just the command help in a md file, but it's a whole lot better than nothing, eh ?

## Project, anyone ?

You might say that is a whole bunch of mess for a puny script, and you'd be very right !
Who says you have to stop with one script though ? I didn't.
You'd have several ways to do that but I settled on a very opinionated project structure that is as follows

```
.
├── <program>
├── <program>.rc
├── completely.bash
├── completely.yaml
├── documentation.md
├── form.html
├── Makefile
├── readme.md
├── bin
│   ├── command-one
│   ├── command-two
│   ├── ...
└── utils
    ├── get_<program>
    ├── install
    └── webserver
```
And of course I made a parseArger command for that : `project`

```bash
parseArger project my-bash-project
```

Off the bat, it'll create the main program, an rc file for your bashrc, documentation, readme and misc stuff (makefile, installer, webserver, html form). It'll initialize a git repo in the created folder but won't add or commit anything.
With some options, it'll also create the `bin` folder and command scripts, configure the main program to use these commands (as for `generate` there'll be another article).

## What belongs to Ceasar

This project was started because I couldn't find out how to modify [argbash](https://github.com/matejak/argbash).
Most of the work was (well) done so I took the generated output and went at building a similar generator.
It is not as fancy as the original work and a bit of "grog brain developer" display ... but, meh, it works *and it's miiiine*.

On that subject, if you are interested in a more rounded up bash generator thingy, you might want to have a look at [bashly](https://github.com/DannyBen/bashly/), I use completely which is a part of it and it's awesome !

## What now ?

Well, have at it ! Have fun, create awesome scripts with sh load of options !
Also as I am the only user, it's getting hard to find bugs to squash, though I am pretty sure nests can be found.
And if no bugs are to be found, maybe you have a use case I didn't think of and everyone would benefit from.
All that can be done using issues on [parseArger's github repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger).

Thanks for the read and I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D )

See you around and happy coding !
1d:T674,
A few years back I started toying with arduino and esp8266. That, was, fun !

Ok, C++ ain't fun, but, you have so many libraries (of various quality, sure, but) that comes with great examples, a few copy and paste, couple of tweaks, boom, you got yourself a working prototype, it is just awesome !

Soon enough though, I got tired of copy-pasting. Keeping different boards (I started to have a few weather stations around the house) in sync was a pain. I wanted to have a common code base, and just a few lines of code to change for each board.

Born was ESPStation, it died quickly when I realised how much I knew of C++, so I started again from scratch, and there was StationIO.

It's far from perfect, or even pretty (it's a mess, but I'll get things sorted out, in time), but it works.

And because I'm (a tiny bit) lazy (did I tell you I was lazy ?), I created a [generator](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/StationIO-Station), in HTML and javascript, for the code ^^. As I was already at it, there an installer script generator, as well ;)

It's another take on the whole IoT stuff. Stations are independant and instead of reporting to a gateway/hub/whatever each has an rest api so you can fetch ionformations from them. 

I find it simpler than having to have an MQTT gateway and also more versatile/resilient as I can talk to each station directly from anywhere on the network.

This means, stations can talk to each other, any computer can talk to any stations, etc... in a more decentralized fashion, me likey.

Now, if you'd rather have it working with MQTT, I'm pretty sure it's a few copy paste away (It's just arduino code, after all).
