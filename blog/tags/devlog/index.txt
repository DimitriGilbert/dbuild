f:T2f74,
## Why ?

I looked for something like that and did not find any, so I am building one !

I will take this opportunity to build it in public, as much as possible ! Meaning most prompts and conversations will be available for you to read and "inspire" yourself !

Why not all conversations ? Well, sometimes, I forget, other times... I'm swearing way too much so it does not bring any value ! (I am grumpy and irritable as a default state, pain makes it worst... at the moment, the pain level oscillate between 2 and 5 out of 10 ^^)

I also want to show others that you can actually create something with AI doing most of the grunt work of dev with "careful" orchestration.

Is it going to be perfect ? XD what a stupid question ! NO ! 'f course not !

Can it get the job done ? I certainly hope so !

## What is it already ?

It is a library/marketplace of Shadcn ui components ! I was tired of hunting for cool components and blocks all around the internet !

Between github lackluster SEO and worst devs' website's one, it is really hard to come across new components, and it is a shame cause some are fantastic !

Also, as a creator of some component (with awful terrible SEOed sites...) i kind of feel unseen, sooo [cn-registry.dev](https://cn-registry.dev) was born !

## The process

Like I said, this is a build in public thing, so I am going to try and share what I learned with you (and my future self if this MF wants to listen !).

How I did things, what worked, what did not really do so, my fuck ups, hope and delusions...

In a sense, I am going to make mistake and look like a fool so you don't have to !

Let's start at the beginning...

### The Idea

Plenty of time I see people asking for ideas on things to build, to other humans, or worse, AI...

No... please don't ! not here !

I sincerely thing ideating is **The** thing that will separate us from machines for awhile still ! You should not delegate that !

"But how do I find ideas then ?" might you witty reader ask me ! And so rightful would you be !

So let me answer you with a question, that could trigger some ideation !

Are there no problem that need solving, in the place that you live in ?

Poetic rhymes aside, solve one of your damn fking problem man (or girl, you are welcome to do so too !) !

That way, even if you don't end up having clients, you'll have solved one of your problem !

For me the problem was "lazy ass dev want find shadcn components easy" ! There you go, how do you solve that problem ?!

### Initial plan

Nothing ground breaking or revolutionary, a dumb directory would do the trick... but that would lack a bit of flair... wouldn't it ?

Solving a simple problem does not necessarily mean a simplistic solution and I was already very keen on over-engineering my own tombstone sooo, let's go for that !

Why not sprinkle some social stuff on it ? It's not because I am limited regarding those skills that others are !

User account, likes, comments ! there you go ! Now we can socialise !

We have the basic Idea of what we want ? Yeah ?

Yeah ! Now we can go bother some AI with it !

### Start proompting

```
I want to build a website using nextjs 15 and shadcn  (i got the stack figured out !) and I need a complete plan to create the front end !
the project is called "cn-registry" and it will be a registry of shadcn components and tools, because hunting for them feels like a full time job.
I want you to plan the needed components and pages, I aim for maximum reusability so if something make sense standalone, it should be ! i do not want you to create code, just the plan !
I want a home page with carousels, one with the 10 latest components, one with the trending one
components will have a name, a description, a repo link, a website, an installation url, categories and each should have a dedicated page with the copiable install command, the repo readme and github info, some showcase with code toggles
Tools will be the same but the install url might be for an npm package or not exists
I want a search page with card or list results and filters on categories
same for tools but on a different page
I want to have a star rating system and user account where user can see the components they stared
User will be able to comment on components
```

As you can see, simple, (in)efficient, (de)organized ! And a couple refinement later, I have my intermediary prompt for V0 !

I wont bore you with the mile long prompt (you have convo link in repo ^^) but it was a good mile long and i did not change much !

Suffice to say that after that I had some "mock data stuffed" frontend prototype for... where am I going to put that... ?!!

### Select your stack

I already did, and you probably should think of that before proompting to be honest ! For me it was easy, I just reached for my current default stack Nextjs front and back, trpc, tailwind and shadcn.

Yes, it is boring. Yes, everyone is doing the same. I don't care.

I start a gazillion projects (and a half) every month cause I am unable to focus on one thing at a time, it doesn't mean I have the cognitive bandwidth to try and learn new stuff every times !

There is also plenty of good docs and resources for all these, which make it easy to work with without too much prior experience

Plus, as a massive, Massive (MASSIVE !) bonus : It works well with AI ! (mostly, sometimes)

Am I saying you should pick this stack ? If you like it, yes, otherwise, i couldn't care less !

Pick what you know, the new hyped stuff or what tickles your fancy ! Really, I couldn't care less, but I care for you to do it right ! Use [better-t-stack](https://better-t-stack.dev) !

yes, this is authoritative, but if your stack is in, use it ! 1 command, boom, project scaffolded and ready to go in seconds (thank me later)

### Let the music start !

```markdown
[x] Idea
[x] Concept
[x] project initialized
[x] frontend prototype
[ ] proper plan
```

Ooooh ? You thought... ? you thought I was going to open my favourite AI agent and start vibing away ?

no no no ! This is not the way ! You are going to go back to your first AI pal you used for the front end prototype plan and you are going to ask it for another plan !

```markdown
I am using the latest version of drizzle orm and postgres so i would like you to carefully plan the whole complete data model I will need,
including user setting and admin/creator utilities table tha migth be needed in the project. we will iterate to align with my goal but try to makee it very comphrehensive
```

It did a pretty good job with my previous frontend plan alignement in one shot soooo...

```
cd workspace/Code/cn-registry;
claude
"I want you to implement the server complete side of the project following this :
  **cn-registry Complete Data Model Plan**
...
  better auth is already setup and running,
  I want schema definition and trpc routes with complete access management for security.
  make sure the apps build when you are done with the backend.
"
```

Et en voiture Simone !

Realignment aside, this got me a building backend that I asked the agent to wire up to the frontend.

### Broken string and other misadventures...

Were you waiting for it ? To be completely honest, I did not think it was going to be so early...but yes, no plan survive contacts with the enemy.

Which enemy ? Trpc ! No no ! not trpc trpc, trpc version and the fact that a major revision came out between the training cut off date and the release/adoption of trpc version...

What does this mean ? AI follows patterns it "knows", guess what it does when it doesn't know the patterns ?

Yup, it's "hallucination time" baby ! Wooooooot Wooooooot ! -\_- Can you feel the pain ? ok, good.

But for a villain in the story, a Hero will come forward, you see

A hero to help the dragons slay, and its name is LLM dot txt

```markdown
my stack is using the following package.json files
Agents often fails on trpc usage because their knowledge is out of date.
I would like you to fetch the lates trpc docs and prepare a comprhensive but concise llm.txt for my agents to work with.
it is only destined towards LLM so you can forgo absolutely all the fluff and present information in the best possible way for you to ingest it efficiently
```

I fed the responded file to my agent, and behold, a few prompts later, I was served dragons' heart for dinner !

### more, More, MOOOOAR

Do you feel the power rising ? The exhileration of AI acceleration ? Is your brain broken and addicted yet ?

Nooo ? well, we are going to have to work on that ! Maybe it's because we lack documentation ?

You are very right ! So I asked gemini cli to do that !

Unfortunatly, i do not have this prompt anymore, but it went something like :

```
I am working on this project [description]
the front and backend are prototyped, the apps build but i did not test anything yet.
I would like you to analyze it very (very ! VERY !!) carefully !
you have to open many files to make sure you understand the app and how it is built.
once done, please create some documentation about that.
```

to which I invariably had to complement after the first response (exact paraphrasing)

```
oooOOOOH FFS ! HOW THE F DO YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING, YOU OPENED 5 FILES, 2 OF THEM WERE PACKAGE.JSON ! OPEN ALL THE FILES ! **ALL OF THEM**
```

Seriously, how does anyone work with gemini these days ? It ended up giving me some decent documentation after that flogging though !

What ? Why do I make the model document the thing already ?

```
Good. now that you have a complete understanding of the full project, i want you to create a plan to finish the implementation of the existing base.
then, I want you to create a plan in better.md that outlines possible enhancement to the base application.
One I want is a cart system so a user can add component to it and get a complete install command for all the components he selected.
be creative and come up with functionalities that would make this platform stand out
```

There you go, this is why ! now that you have something more than a couple of sentence, agents can stretch their legs !

What do similar enough architectures and software have as functionalities ? It will know ! You'll be left with the cherry picking and it might even give you more ideas !

### Tidy up and go forward

Armed with gemini's assertion of the codebase, I asked claude to do the work (you would have to pay me to allow gemini modifying my files !)

Once complete I asked it to create a proper plan for the extra functionalities I chose

- cart system
- project system
- github integration
- creator profiles

It gracefully did that while I started testing the app. Systematic clicking and typing, going from error to error, indexing them by small groups, asking my agent to take care of them.

This is the perfect occasion to start having a look at the code... yes, just now.

To be fair, I was probably less than 3 hours in and I also come from a time where bootstrapping an app was probably that long sooooo... not saying this is good, but I have done that a dozen times already and I know what to expect.

Bug hunting took an hour or so, nothing major, missing "use client", dumb state management, over complicated logic, a bunch of alerts and prompts, in short, claude's specials (I was spared me the blueish purple gradient this time though...)

Implementing the improvement plan was business as usual and took around another 3-4 hours

```
in @improvements.md implement phase/part ...
```

### One day at a time

I realize this is getting long, and, well it is the end of day 1 so I am going to stop here for now !

At that moment I had a mostly working app, with an admin side i could get in, component and tools could be added.

And as my eyes were all closing, I could not see shadows brewing

Covering me with joy and warm for my app worked like a charm

An innocent small idea that would become ...[find me a noun of something bad finishing by the sound a, i need a rhyme]

In the mean time, here is the [demo](https://cn-registry.dev) and the [repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/cn-registry), feedback greatly appreciated as always !
10:T3674,
## Pourquoi ?

J'ai cherché un truc comme ça et j'ai rien trouvé, alors je le construis !

Je vais en profiter pour le construire en public, autant que faire se peut ! Ca veuut dire que la plupart des prompts et des conversations seront disponibles pour les lire et s'en inspirer !

Pourquoi pas toutes les conversations ? Euuuh alors... bon... parfois, j'oublie. Eeeet euuuh d'autres fois... disons que c'est pas tellement family friendly ^^ ! (Je suis grincheux et irritable par défaut, quand j'ai mal, c'est pire... en ce moment, ca oscille entre 2 et 5 sur 10 ^^)

Je veux aussi montrer/prouver a d'autres qu'il est possible d'utiliser l'IA pour generer la majorité du code avec une "orchestration" minutieuse.

Est-ce que ce sera parfait ? XD quelle question stupide ! NON ! Bien sûr que non !

Est-ce que ça va faire le travail ? J'espère bien !

## Qu'est-ce que c'est déjà ?

C'est une bibliothèque/un marketplace de composants Shadcn ! J'en avais marre de chercher des composants et des blocs sympas un peu partout sur Internet !

Entre la SEO médiocre de GitHub et celle encore pires des sites de développeurs, c'est vraiment pas facile de tomber sur de nouveaux composants, et c'est dommage car certains sont fantastiques !

En plus, en tant que créateur de composants (avec des sites... dont le SEO est affreux...), je me sens un peu invisible, alors [cn-registry.dev](https://cn-registry.dev) est né !

## Le processus

Comme je l'ai dit, il s'agit d'une build in public, alors je vais partager avec vous ce que j'apprends (et mon futur moi si ce con se met a ecouter !).

Comment j'ai fait, ce qui a fonctionné, ou pas, mes conneries, mes espoirs et mes illusions...

En gros, je vais faire des erreurs et avoir l'air d'un idiot pour que vous n'ayez pas à le faire !

Commençons par le début...

### L'idée

C'est souventque je vois des gens demander des idées sur quoi construire, à d'autres, ou pire, à l'IA...

Non... s'il vous plaît, pas ici !

En vrai, l'idéation (oh je vais pas traduire un mot qu'existe pas non plus !) est **la** chose qui nous resteras face machines pour encore un moment ! Faut pas déléguer ca !

"Mais comment trouver des idées alors ?" pourrait me demander mon lecteur astucieux ! Et vous auriez tout à fait raison de le faire !

Alors laissez-moi vous répondre par une question qui pourrait déclencher un peu d'idéation !

Y a-t-il des problèmes à résoudre, là où vous vivez ?

_les 3 phrases d'avant marche tellement pas en francais, mais je les laisse tellement la traduction est moisie x-)_

Traduction en carton à part, résous un de **tes** problèmes mec (ou meuf, z'êtes également les bienvenus !) !

Comme ca, même si personne s'en sert, t'auras résolu un de tes problèmes !

Pour moi, le problème était "dev faignasse chereche composant shadcn facilement" ! Et voila, maintaint, comment on s'occupe de ca ?!

### Plan initial

Rien de révolutionnaire ou de génial, un bete annuaire ferait l'affaire... mais ca manque un peu de pepse... non ?

Problème simple ne signifie pas nécessairement solution simpliste et j'aime deja bien les usines a gaz alors, allons-y !

Pourquoi ne pas ajouter un peu de social ? C'est pas parce que je suis incompétent (ca marche aussi en 2 mots) sociales que les autres le sont !

Comptes utilisateurs, likes, commentaires ! Et hop, maintenant on socialise !

Bon, on a l'idée de base en entier ? Oui ?

Oui ! Et bhe y'a plus qu'a aller embêter une IA avec ça !

### A vos marques, pret, proomptez !

Oui, les prompts sont encores en anglais, ca marche mieux. vraiment !

```
I want to build a website using nextjs 15 and shadcn  (i got the stack figured out !) and I need a complete plan to create the front end !
the project is called "cn-registry" and it will be a registry of shadcn components and tools, because hunting for them feels like a full time job.
I want you to plan the needed components and pages, I aim for maximum reusability so if something make sense standalone, it should be ! i do not want you to create code, just the plan !
I want a home page with carousels, one with the 10 latest components, one with the trending one
components will have a name, a description, a repo link, a website, an installation url, categories and each should have a dedicated page with the copiable install command, the repo readme and github info, some showcase with code toggles
Tools will be the same but the install url might be for an npm package or not exists
I want a search page with card or list results and filters on categories
same for tools but on a different page
I want to have a star rating system and user account where user can see the components they stared
User will be able to comment on components
```

Commeon peut le voir, simple, (in)efficace, (dés)organisé ! Et quelques raffinements plus tard, j'ai mon prompt intermédiaire pour V0 !

Je ne vais pas vous ennuyer avec le prompt interminable (vous avez le lien de conversation dans le repo ^^), mais il était interminable et j'ai pas beaucoup changé de choses !

Apres le passage chez V0, j'avais un prototype de front-end avec des données simulées pour... Mais je vais le mettre où ça moi... ?!

### Sélectionnez votre stack

Perso, je l'ai déjà fait, et vous devriez probablement y penser avant de prompt en vrai ! Pour moi, c'était facile, j'ai pris ma stack par défaut du moment : Nextjs front et back, trpc, tailwind et shadcn.

Oui, c'est ennuyeux. Oui, tout le monde fait la même chose. Je m'en tape le coquillard !

Je commence un milliard de projets (et demi) chaque mois parce que je suis incapable de me concentrer sur une seule chose à la fois, ca veut pas dire que j'ai la de bande pasaante pour apprendre de nouvelles choses à chaque fois !

Il y a aussi pas mal de bonnes docs et ressources pour toutes ces technos, ca facilite le travail meme sans trop d'expérience préalable.

Et pour rien gacher, un gros, Gros (mais genre GROS) bonus : Cela fonctionne bien avec l'IA ! (enfin, des fois, un peu)

Est-ce que je dis que vous devriez choisir cette stack ? Si vous l'aimez, oui, sinon, je m'en fiche complètement !

Choisissez ce que vous connaissez, la nouvelle stack à la mode ou ce qui vous titille ! Vraiment, je m'en fiche complètement, mais je me soucie que vous le fassiez correctement ! Utilisez [better-t-stack](https://better-t-stack.dev) !

Oui, c'est autoritaire, mais si votre stack est dedans, utilisez ca ! 1 commande, boom, projet tout chaud et prêt à decoller en quelques secondes (remercie moi plus tard)

### Laissez la musique commencer !

```markdown
[x] Idée
[x] Concept
[x] projet initialisé
[x] prototype frontend
[ ] plan approprié
```

Ooooh ? Vous pensiez... ? vous pensiez que j'allais ouvrir mon agent IA préféré et commencer à vibe coder ?

uuuhh non non non ! pas la, pas encore ! la, on retourne à notre premier pote qu'on a utilisé pour le plan du front-end et on va lui demander un autre plan !

```markdown
I am using the latest version of drizzle orm and postgres so i would like you to carefully plan the whole complete data model I will need,
including user setting and admin/creator utilities table tha migth be needed in the project. we will iterate to align with my goal but try to makee it very comphrehensive
```

Comme j'ai deja reorientez les choses pour le front end, j'ai eu le droit a un joli plan en one shot, donc...

```
cd workspace/Code/cn-registry;
claude
"I want you to implement the server complete side of the project following this :
  **cn-registry Complete Data Model Plan**
...
  better auth is already setup and running,
  I want schema definition and trpc routes with complete access management for security.
  make sure the apps build when you are done with the backend.
"
```

Et en voiture Simone !

Mis à part les petites reorientations, ca m'a donné un backend "fonctionnel" (a une vache pres !) donc j'ai demandé à l'agent de connecter ca au frontend.

### C'est Bestel, il a mis la cassette et puis pouf !

Vous l'attendiez ? Pour être tout à fait honnête, je ne pensais pas que ce serait si tôt... mais oui, aucun plan ne survit au contact de l'ennemi.

Quel ennemi ? Trpc ! Non non ! pas trpc trpc (c'est très bien trpc !), la version de trpc et le fait qu'une révision majeure est sortie entre la date de coupure d'entrainement de claude et maintenant......

Qu'est ce que donc que ca pourrait il vouloir bien dire toussa ? Les LLMs suivent des schémas qu'elles "connaissent", et devinez ce qu'elles font quand elles connaîssentt pas les schémas ?

Ouep, c'est ca, elles "hallucinent" leurs mamies ! Wooooooot Wooooooot ! -\_- J'espere que vous sentez la douleur !

Mais pour un méchant dans l'histoire, un Héros se présentera un beau soir

Un héros pour aider les dragons à être tués, et son nom est LLM point txt

_eeeett vous savez a quoi on reconnaît des bonnes ryhmes ? elles se traduisent toutes seules!_

```markdown
my stack is using the following package.json files
Agents often fails on trpc usage because their knowledge is out of date.
I would like you to fetch the lates trpc docs and prepare a comprhensive but concise llm.txt for my agents to work with.
it is only destined towards LLM so you can forgo absolutely all the fluff and present information in the best possible way for you to ingest it efficiently
```

J'ai gavé la réponse à mon agent, et après quelques prompts, on m'a servi le cœur du dragon pour le dîner !

### encore, Encore, ENCOOORE

Vous sentez la puissance monter ? L'exaltation de l'accélération par l'IA ? Votre cerveau est-il déjà accro ? Non ? Eh bhe on va devoir travailler là-dessus !

Manque de la doc peut etre ?

Mais tout a fait tout a fait, allons voir ce bon vieux gemini !

je n'ai plus ce prompt, mais c'était quelque chose comme :

```
I am working on this project [description]
the front and backend are prototyped, the apps build but i did not test anything yet.
I would like you to analyze it very (very ! VERY !!) carefully !
you have to open many files to make sure you understand the app and how it is built.
once done, please create some documentation about that.
```

que j'ai invariablement dû compléter après la première réponse par un joyeux (paraphrase exacte)

```
oooOOOOH FFS ! HOW THE F DO YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING, YOU OPENED 5 FILES, 2 OF THEM WERE PACKAGE.JSON ! OPEN ALL THE FILES ! **ALL OF THEM**
```

Sérieusement, qui arrive a bosser avec gemini (vrais question !) ? Bon apres cette petite sceance de fouettage gemini m'as finalement pondus une doc correct !

De quoi, quoi ? Pourquoi j'ai fait documenter le taf par l'IA ?

```
Good. now that you have a complete understanding of the full project, i want you to create a plan to finish the implementation of the existing base.
then, I want you to create a plan in better.md that outlines possible enhancement to the base application.
One I want is a cart system so a user can add component to it and get a complete install command for all the components he selected.
be creative and come up with functionalities that would make this platform stand out
```

Voilà pourquoi ! Pour bien bosser les LLM ont besoin de plus de 2 phrases de contexte, avec une vision plus précise du code, l'IA pourra planifier plus efficacement !

Quelles fonctionnalités et architectures sont utilisé dans des logiciels similaires ? Il le saura ! Z'aurez plus qu'as faire vos emplettes et ca pourras meme debloquer d'autres idées !

### Vous en avez mare de ces details ? et bhe on va vous en débarrasser

Armés de l'étude de gemini sur mon code, j'ai demandé à claude de faire le travail (Faudrais me payer pour laisser gemini s'approcher de ma codebase en ecriture !).

Une fois finis, je luiai demandé de créer un plan plus precis pour les fonctionnalités supplémentaires que j'ai choisies

- système de panier
- système de projet
- intégration GitHub
- profils créateurs

Il l'a tres grâcieusement fait pendant que je commençais à tester l'application.

Click frenetique et topotage systématiques, passage d'erreur en erreur, indexation par petits groupes, envoyé a l'agent qui n'en fait qu'une bouchée !

C'est l'occasion parfaite pour commencer à examiner le code... oui oui, que maintenant.

En vrai, J'y etais depuis moins de 3 heures et j'ai commancé ma carriere a une époque où tout mettre en place pour dev une application prenait probablement aussi longtemps donc...

je ne dis pas que c'est bien, mais ca fait une bonne douzaine de fois que je commence du dev comme ca et je sais à quoi m'attendre en terme de code.

La chasse aux bugs a pris environ une heure, rien de majeur, "use client" manquant, mauvaise gestion d'état, logique trop compliquée, un tas d'alertes et de prompts, en bref, les spécialités de claude (et j'ai pas subi les gradients bleu violacé cette fois-ci ...)

### Un jour à la fois

Bon... ce post devient long, et comme c'est la fin du jour 1, je vais m'arrêter ici :D !

À ce moment-là, j'avais une app quasi fonctionnelle, avec un côté admin, les composants et les outils pouvaient être ajoutés.

_je vais les laisser comme ca aussi les suivantes, le jours ou l'IA traduit les ryhmes, on est cuit les lapins!_

Et alors que mes yeux se fermaient tous, je ne pouvais pas voir les ombres qui se formaient.

Me couvrant de joie et de chaleur pour mon application qui fonctionnait comme un charme.

Une petite idée innocente qui deviendrait... [trouvez-moi un nom de quelque chose de mauvais se terminant par le son a, j'ai besoin d'une rime].

En attendant, voici la [démo](https://cn-registry.dev) et le [dépôt](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/cn-registry). Vos retours sont, comme toujours, grandement appréciés !
11:T5c6,
You can now use a "namespace" for options.

It will create an associative array with passed keys and values !

## Usage

These are the arguments for the `nested` sub command :

```bash
arg-name: nested option namespace
description: positional argument description
--one-of <one-of>: accepted values for keys, repeatable
--complete <complete>: bash built-in completely function, repeatable
--complete-custom <complete-custom>: completely custom dynamic suggestion, repeatable
```

This is how to generate (or add using `parse` !) a script using it:

```bash
parseArger generate --output my-script --nested 'opt-ns "a nested option"';
```

And this is how to use said script:

```bash
./my-script --opt-ns-a "value" --opt-ns-b "b value" --opt-ns-option "my opt" --opt-ns-blabla "lorem ispum";
```

The nested value are in an associative array as follow :

```bash
echo _arg_opt_ns["a"];
# value
echo _arg_opt_ns["b"];
# b value
echo _arg_opt_ns["option"];
# my opt
echo _arg_opt_ns["blabla"];
# lorem ispum
```

## To do what ?

Sometimes when scripting, you are using other CLI programs.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to pass specific option to that programs, from the CLI, you know, to make your scripts more extensible/user friendly !

## What now ?

I'm heading back to unit test land, so you do you my lil' friend ;)

I just realized I didn't not document the `nested` options, so I just came to do that !

12:T231b,
A small article on an mdd update, and the process behind it. Nothing fancy, but a little bit of food for thoughts ;).

## Why is this even a post

First of all, I'm trying to make content ! And, also, I almost went at it "the wrong way", so I thought it would be a good idea to share my experience.

Now, if you never put your foot in your mouth when doing something, you should pass on the read, otherwise, you might find something interesting or at least feel less lonely.

It's on a very small scale and that is why I think it is such a good example. On top of which, you already are familiar with the project so you won't be lost, and also, it's a tutorial project...i'm gonna milk it !

## TLDR

I wanted to go at it fancy, separation between stuff and all, but I ended up doing it the simple way, and it's fine. At least for now.

Yes, it would have worked otherwise, it would have been fine or even great, prepared for improvement and shit, but, a mix of "meh, can't be bothered" and, "hum, i certainly don't need that now..." got the better of the fancyness.

Let's see how it all happened.

## Heads first

* "I should create entry for my projects on the site....huuuuuu, booooorrriiiing...."
* "well, you have a tool for that big dumb dumb" (yes, we are talking to myself, no judgement !)
* "oooh yeah, hum... but it creates article only..."
* "dude, decouple your thumbs from Uranus !"
* "huuuuuu.....OOOOO KKAAAYYY...."

```bash
parseArger generate \
  --output bin/category \
  --help-message "create a new category" \
  --pos 'title "category title"' \
  --opt 'folder "article folder name" --alias directory --alias dir' \
  --opt 'categories "article parent categories" --short c --repeat --alias cat --alias parent' \
  --opt 'date "publication date meta" --short d --alias publication --alias publish-at' \
  --opt 'summary "summary meta" --short s --alias description --alias desc' \
  --nested 'meta "add any meta you want"'
```

And then take that from `article`, and that, oh, and that, and....

## Heeeyy, wait a minute, AKA duh

So, all I did for the last 37 seconds (damn, [parseArger](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger) is SOOOO coool !) is copy pasting article to make a simpler version of it.

Because, when you think about it, categories in Hugo are just articles, but instead onf a `index.md` file, you have a `_index.md`, maybe, just maybe, we could add an option to specify the file name, it would even make `mdd article` more versatile.

To make things a bit more user friendly (yes, you can have friendly CLI !), we'll also add a flag to say it's a category so you don't have to write `--filename _index.md` every time.

```bash
parseArger parse bin/article -i \
  --opt 'filename "markdown file name" --default-value index.md' \
  --flag 'is-category "this is a category, using _index.md as filename" --alias is-cat'
```

Let's modify our `bin/article file to reflect the new constraints.

```bash
# the end of the file 
if [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ] && [ -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then 
  rm "${_container_dir}/index.md" -f; 
fi
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then
	if [ "$_arg_template" == "" ] || [ ! -f "$_arg_template" ]; then
		if [ "$_arg_template" != "" ]; then
			log "template $_arg_template not found" -1;
		fi
		log "using default template" 4;
		_arg_template="${_SCRIPT_DIR}/../templates/article.md";
	fi
	sed \
		-e "s/{{metas}}/$_metas_str/g" \
		-e "s/{{content}}/$_contents_str/g" \
		"$_arg_template" > "${_container_dir}/index.md";
else
	die "file already exists: ${_container_dir}";
fi

# is now 
# if is-category and filename not specified
if [ "$_arg_is_category" == "on" ] && [ "$_arg_filename" == "index.md" ]; then
	_arg_filename="_index.md";
fi

# using _arg_filename instead of index.md
if [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ] && [ -f "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}" ]; then 
  rm "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}" -f; 
fi
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}" ]; then
	if [ "$_arg_template" == "" ] || [ ! -f "$_arg_template" ]; then
		if [ "$_arg_template" != "" ]; then
			log "template $_arg_template not found" -1;
		fi
		log "using default template" 4;
		_arg_template="${_SCRIPT_DIR}/../templates/article.md";
	fi
	sed \
		-e "s/{{metas}}/$_metas_str/g" \
		-e "s/{{content}}/$_contents_str/g" \
		"$_arg_template" > "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}";
else
	die "file already exists: ${_container_dir}";
fi

```

That simple, not even 10 lines (6, 6 lines, I counted them on re-read....dawn you braiiiin) ! Definitly worth it if you consider the alternative would have been a new file, with mostly duplicated code.

I could have called `mdd article` in my new command and then renamed `index.md` to `_index.md`, but it did not seem like a great solution to add 500 lines of code and another file for 10 lines of functionality, when i could add 10 (6 I said ! and most of it is modification) more lines and do more.

## Bug fixes and chores

Well, let's test our new toy, shall we ?

```bash
mdd article mdd --cat Projects --is-category \
  --summary "My MarkDown tools, a parseArger tutorial project"
```

Directory and file created ok, let's add an article then.

```bash
mdd article "Story of a simple update" \
  --summary "No plans survive first contact, the best part is no part, check yo' stagin'\!" \
  --h2 "Why is this even a post" \
  --h2 "TLDR" \
  --h2 "Heads first" \
  --h2 "Heeeyy, wait a minute, AKA 'duh'" \
  --h2 "Conclusion" \
  --h2 "What now ?" \
  --cat Projects \
  --cat mdd \
  --tag parseArger \
  --tag mdd \
  --tag devlog \
  --tag bash \
  --tag tutorial
```

aaannnnnd `ERROR 2023/11/05 10:46:34 Rebuild failed: "/src/content/Projects/mdd/Story of a simple update/index.md:4:1": failed to unmarshal YAML: yaml: line 4: found character that cannot start any token`, NOOOPE !

A few minutes of head scratching, couple of copy paste and test and, yup, YAML do not like `\t` for arrays, it wants `  `... fine, what...eeeever.

```bash
if [ "${#_arg_tags[@]}" -gt 0  ]; then
	log "${#_arg_tags[@]} tags specified:" 4;
	_metas_str+="tags: \n";
	for _tg in "${_arg_tags[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tg" 4;
		_metas_str+="\t- $_tg\n";
	done
fi

# is now this
if [ "${#_arg_tags[@]}" -gt 0  ]; then
	log "${#_arg_tags[@]} tags specified:" 4;
	_metas_str+="tags: \n";
	for _tg in "${_arg_tags[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tg" 4;
    # RIGHT HERE, YOOOHOO
		_metas_str+="  - $_tg\n";
	done
fi
```

Aaaand, ....,  it does not crash anymore \o/.

Maybe `article` for the command is not as good now, let's change it to `new` we have to regenerate doc and completion anyway.

```bash
mv bin/article bin/new
rm -f bin/category
```

Edit mdd and modify parsearger declaration to remove `--one-of article`, it won't be remove automagically, even if bin-directory it's on purpose, I'll probably add a flag for this behavior later

```bash
# edit mdd replace
@parseArger pos target "mdd subcommand" --subcommand-directory "bin" --subcommand-run --subcommand-use-leftovers --subcommand --one-of "article" --one-of "new"
# with
@parseArger pos target "mdd subcommand" --subcommand-directory "bin" --subcommand-run --subcommand-use-leftovers --subcommand --one-of "new"
```

A bit of parsing magic before documentation and completion generation.

```bash
parseArger parse -i mdd

parseArger completely "mdd" ./mdd --subcommand-directory ./bin --no-run-completely > completely.yaml
completely preview > completely.bash

parseArger document --file ./mdd  --directory ./bin --title "MarkDown for Didi" > documentation.md

git add bin/new
git commit -am 'ename to new + category creation + tag bug fix'
git push origin main
```

It's now all ready to go \o/.

## Conclusion

Sometimes you don't need a bazooka to kill a fly, sometimes, you don't even need a gun (trust me, if I had access to guns, I'd use that to kill flies, of course I would !) and sometimes you don't even need to kill this fly... BUT not Today !

**heavy hand droping on the table**

Oh no, Today, we squashed the damn bugger by doing almost nothing !

Joking aside, I think that there's a place and time for complexity, but it was not it.

The main objective of this project is simplicity, and adding that much more surface area so early did seem to go against that.

If there is something I realized over the years, fancy don't always mean effective, whether it's a small joke project or a big gargantuous blob of a software and we as `engineers` have a small (tiny, little, puny, dare I say it, nanoscopic !) tendency to want to add complexity, `because`.

Just, be aware of it when you plan your next stuff, and this was a good example ;)

## What now ?

Nothing much, we had a look at updating a parseArger project and went over a bit of KISS principle. 
Maybe it made you realize you went overboard with some of your work ? Do you have a way of alleviating this kind of behavior ? And, do you even care or do you embrace complexity and overkill ?

13:T2f99,
## Let's create a project together !

I'm one of those `learn by doing` guys (mostly), I'm assuming your kind of are too, so let's build something together.

### A bit of context and basic requirements

For this blog, I'm using [hugo](https://gohugo.io) as a static site generator, and I'm writing my articles in markdown.
`hugo new` does the job, but I want something a bit different, with a folder that contains everything I need for the article (asset, code, etc...).
I would like my new post to be prefilled as much as possible so the tool should be able to set any meta.
Also, I tend to craft my article squeletton before writting (#trauma #school XD), so I should at least be able to add main headings from the CLI.
Because I do not know where this is goping, I won't just `generate` a script, I am going to start a new `project` so I can add more stuff later on.

## Leeeeeet's goooooo !

### Generate the project

We are using the `project` command, more information can be found in the [previous article]() if you need help.

```bash
# create a new project called mdd (MarkDown for Didi. Much creativity, such accronym, #wow)
# one subcommand 'article' for now.
parseArger project mdd \
  --description "markdown tools for my blog" \
  --git-repo "DimitriGilbert/mdd" \
  --project-subcommand article
```

This command will create a new folder `mdd` with the following structure:

```bash
|_ mdd
|_ documentation.md
|_ form.html
|_ Makefile
|_ readme.md
|_ bin
  |_ article
|_ utils
  |_ get_mdd
  |_ install
  |_ webserver 
```

Our entry point `mdd` should handle the command routing on its own, no work needed so we go along to `article`.

### Parse the article command

After some careful thoughts, I have refined my requirements which are now the following:

* create a new folder with the article name
  * if $(pwd) contains a `content` folder, create the article in it
  * article can have hierarchical categories. (if more than one, the previous is the parent)
    * categories make the path to the article
* create index.md from template you can specify
* tags, series, title, draft (on), date (now), summary metas handled by CLI
  * add any other meta you want
* add headings
  * headings level can be specified

From all that, we know that we'll need the folowing :
* arguments : 
  * title (the only thing mandatory, so it's an argument)
* options : 
  * categories (repeatable)
  * folder name (not strictly necessary, but i can forsee a need soooo...)
  * tags (repeatable)
  * series (repeatable)
  * date
  * summary
  * template
  * headings (repeatable)
  * headings level (default 2)
* flags :
  * draft (on by default)
* nested options :
  * meta
    * due to bash limitation, no repeatable nested options, so only the last value for a key will be kept

With that in mind, let's build our `parse` command to update our `bin/article` file. Don't forget to remove comment before executing, they don't play well with backslashes ^^.

```bash
# parse the bin/article file
parseArger parse bin/article \
  # add the title argument, nothing special here
  --pos 'title "article title"' \
  # add the folder name option, using title if none provided. I also declare aliases for this option, namely 'dir' and 'directory'
  --opt 'folder "article folder name" --alias directory --alias dir' \
  # add the categories option, repeatable, with aliases 'cat' and 'parent', a short version of the option is given, namely 'c'
  --opt 'categories "article parent categories" --short c --alias cat --alias parent --repeat' \
  # add the tags option, repeatable, with alias 'tag' and short option 't'
  --opt 'tags "article tags" --repeat --short t --alias tag' \
  # add the series option, with alias 'group' and short option 'g'
  --opt 'series "article belongs to this series" --alias group --short g' \
  # add the date option with short option 'd' and aliases 'publication', 'publish-at'
  --opt 'date "publication date meta" --alias publication --alias publish-at --short d' \
  # add the summary option with short option 's' and aliases 'description', 'desc'
  --opt 'summary "summary meta" --short s --alias description --alias desc' \
  # add the template option with short option 'tpl' and alias 'template'
  --opt 'template "template file to use" --alias tpl' \
  # add the headings option, repeatable, with short option 'h' and aliases 'part', 'h2'
  --opt 'headings "add headings to your file" --repeat --alias part --alias h2' \
  # add the headings level option with short option 'hl' and alias 'headings-level'
  --opt 'headings-level "heading level" --default-value 2 --alias hl' \
  # add the draft flag on by default and with a no-alias as publish 
  #   meaning if you want it off, you can either use --no-draft or --publish
  --flag 'draft "is it a draft" --on --no-alias publish' \
  # add the meta nested option
  --nested-options 'meta "add any meta you want"' \
  # parse in place, -i is the short option
  --in-place
```

This will give us the following `bin/article` file :

{{% fileContent file="/content/Projects/parseArger/My markdown tool, a parsearger project/article_v1" language="bash" %}}

It's a whole bunch of code, but mercyfully you do not have to pay attention to it \o/ (I mean, you can if you want, but it's not necessary).

Instead we are going to focus on the code that is going to use those parsed arguments and stuff !

### The (real) code

Well, let's start fullfilling our requirements !

#### Folder stuff

I use the log function with a level of 4 for comments ;)

```bash
# if nothing else, the title
_container_dir="$_arg_title";

if [ "$_arg_folder" != "" ]; then
	log "folder specified: $_arg_folder" 4;
	_container_dir="$_arg_folder";
fi

# there is categories at least 1
if [ "${#_arg_categories[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
	log "categories specified:" 4;
	_cat_dir="";
	for _cat in "${_arg_categories[@]}"; do
		_cat_dir+="$_cat/";
	done
	log "	categories path : $_cat_dir" 4;
	_container_dir="$_cat_dir$_container_dir";
fi

# hugo directory, it's a poor check , I don't care ^^
if [ -d "content" ]; then
	log "using content directory" 4;
	_container_dir="content/$_container_dir";
fi

# create the directory if it does not exist
if [ ! -d "$_container_dir" ]; then
	log "creating container directory: $_container_dir" 2;
	mkdir -p "$_container_dir";
fi
```

#### Meta stuff

Here we'll handle all the metas so that we can put that to rest.

```bash
# start with the title, it's always here
_metas_str="title: $_arg_title\n";

if [ "$_arg_date" != "" ]; then
	log "date specified: $_arg_date" 4;
	_metas_str+="date: $_arg_date\n";
fi

if [ "$_arg_summary" != "" ]; then
	log "summary specified: $_arg_summary" 4;
	_metas_str+="summary: $_arg_summary\n";
fi

if [ "${#_arg_tags[@]}" -gt 0  ]; then
	log "${#_arg_tags[@]} tags specified:" 4;
	_metas_str+="tags: \n";
	for _tg in "${_arg_tags[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tg" 4;
		_metas_str+="\t- $_tg\n";
	done
fi

if [ "$_arg_series" != "" ]; then
	log "series specified: $_arg_series" 4;
	_metas_str+="series: $_arg_series\n";
fi

if [ "$_arg_draft" == "on" ]; then
	log "draft on" 4;
	_metas_str+="draft: true\n";
fi

if [ "${#_arg_ns_meta[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
	log "other metas specified:" 4;
	for _tmp_k_meta in "${!_arg_ns_meta[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tmp_k_meta: ${_arg_ns_meta[$_tmp_k_meta]}" 4;
		_metas_str+="$_tmp_k_meta: ${_arg_ns_meta[$_tmp_k_meta]}\n";
	done
fi
```

#### Creating the headings

My article squeletton straight from the CLI

```bash
# empty content by default
_content_str="";
if [ "${#_arg_headings[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
	_hd_level_str="";
	for (( i=0; i<_arg_headings_level; i++ )); do
		_hd_level_str+="#";
	done

	log "headings specified:" 4;
	for _hd in "${_arg_headings[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_hd" 4;
		_contents_str+="\n$_hd_level_str $_hd\n\n\n";
	done
fi
```

#### Creating the index.md file

Creating the file itself, but, damn, even after *careful thoughts* it looks like I'm missing something....

We'll have to come back to that later i guess...

```bash

# dont erase stuff willy nilly, but, hum, looks like I'm missing something here...
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then
	if [ "$_arg_template" == "" ] || [ ! -f "$_arg_template" ]; then
		if [ "$_arg_template" != "" ]; then
			log "template $_arg_template not found" -1;
		fi
		log "using default template" 4;
		_arg_template="${_SCRIPT_DIR}/../templates/article.md";
	fi
	sed \
		-e "s/{{metas}}/$_metas_str/g" \
		-e "s/{{content}}/$_contents_str/g" \
		"$_arg_template" > "${_container_dir}/index.md";
else
	die "file already exists: ${_container_dir}";
fi
```

befor going any further, let's test what we have so far :

```bash
./mdd article "A test article" \
  --cat my-cat \
  --cat "sub category" \
  -s "this is just a test" \
  --folder "My test article" \
  --h2 "A title for my test" --h2 "a second part to the test" --h2 "Conclusion"
```

Executing this command gives us the following structure :

```bash
|_ my-cat
  |_ sub category
    |_ My test article
      |_ index.md
```

and `cat "my-cat/sub category/My test article/index.md"` :

```markdown
---
title: A test article
summary: this is just a test
draft: true

---

## A title for my test



## a second part to the test



## Conclusion
```

Well, looks like success to me !
Now let's get back to what we missed earlier !

#### Allow ovverride of index.md

Yeah, that's what we forgot, we need to be able to override the index.md file, so let's add a flag for that.

```bash
parseArger parse bin/article -i --flag 'force "erase if exists"'
```

This modify the parsing code so we just need to update the code accordingly :

this : 
```bash
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then
	...
```
becomes that :
```bash
if [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ] && [ -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then 
  rm "${_container_dir}/index.md" -f; 
fi
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ] || [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ]; then
	...
```

I do it this way if (when ?) we add a backup system ;)

### Nice to haves

Let"s take care of our QoL as developers and help our future selves, let's start with documentation.

```bash
parseArger document --file ./mdd  --directory ./bin --title "MarkDown for Didi" > documentation.md
```

I just pipe the result too the file, je suis un geudin, faut pas me chercher !

Completion is next, and as usual for me, something crashes, the "normal" command is as follow :

```bash
parseArger completely "mdd" ./mdd --subcommand-directory ./bin
```

which fails for me, but I use this workaround :

```bash
parseArger completely "mdd" ./mdd --subcommand-directory ./bin --no-run-completely > completely.yaml
completely preview > completely.bash
```

Why does this work when otherwise fail ? `\_(ツ)_/`

That done, the rc file require creation, this is the content :

```bash
if [ "${MDD_DIR}" != "" ]; then
  alias mdd="${MDD_DIR}/mdd";
  [ -f "${MDD_DIR}/completely.bash" ] && source "${MDD_DIR}/completely.bash";
fi
```

A small detour by the readme file to fill a bit of information :

```markdown
# Markdown for Didi

Markdown tools for my blog.
This is a tutorial project for [parseArger](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger).
```

### Tidy up !

I'll remove the form and the makefile, I don't need them for this project.
And if I end up doing, their just a command away ^^

```bash
rm -f form.html Makefile
```

If you followed along you might have extra directory from your test, don't forget to clean them !
And we're just left with a commit to be done for now !

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
# hub create <repo>
git push origin main
```

## What now ?

I won't re write a heroic fantasy introduction in lieu of conclusion this time, but for real, I kinda have nothing more to teach you on parseArger for now.

As for `mdd`, I'll probably add some stuff to it, but I don't know what yet, so I'll just leave it there for now. [bug report, feature request and PR](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/mdd) are welcome though, I don't promise quick support but I'll sure have a look ;)

I'll probably go over a few other stuff I created before writting again about parseArger, but it'll be back, I promise !
