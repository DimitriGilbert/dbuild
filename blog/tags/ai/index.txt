f:T3d6f,
I wont reintroduce the concept of Ralph loop, if you have been anywhere near AI in the first half of January 2026, you have heard of it ! If not, you should go and watch [Theo's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr9O6KFwbW4) (or someone else's but this is a good !)

You probably know which comics character Ralph is refering to, but Eric... who could it possibly be ?

If you thought short, fat and angry, you'd be right ! I'm of course talking about Eric Cartman from South Park !

While Ralph is naive and innocent, Eric is calculating and manipulative. Not something I'd look for in a Human, but for managing a bunch of AIs ? HELL YEAH !

## The Eric Loop

An idea, even if good, always need some work and some back and forth to be implemented. So we first expose the idea to the AI to get an requirement document (PRD) and we work on it !

How ? you'll need to read first ! and straight away update parts you don't agree with or things you need to be more thorough !

Once that is done, ask AI models to ask You questions about the PRD and give all those, the PRD and your replies to another AI for update

Rince, Repeat, until you are satisfied with the document.

You can even get multiple model go at it to then compare and merge the outputs, using AI, of course :D

This is where we start diverging from the basic Ralph loop. instead of just passing that to the AI and hoping tasks will be implemented properly we get an AI to pre split and formalise the tasks and sub tasks into a list !

The rift grows further as we split the task implementation in several steps with:
* a planning phase that analyzes the requirements for the tasks, existing code, and conduct the needed research
* an execution phase to do the actual work,
* an optional automated verification phase (check types, build, tests, ...) with automated feedback to the execution phase in case of errors,
* an result review phase, that can send back to the execution phase for further refinement.

Once all that is done ? the Eric loop goes on for the next phase of the plan, just like Ralph !

## But, Why... ?

Separation of concerns !

Yes models have gotten smarter, but if you played around with sub agents and skills, you know that prompting is not dead (yet...)

Having a neat separation like that helps you have better prompts for each phase of the task execution.

As a side effect, it mmeans you can control which model is used for which phase maybe you dont need Opus the whole way if it made a banger plan !

## What would it look like ?

We are going to create a small project from an idea I have, you can do it to if you like !

It's called Tiny-till, a small app to have a simple till for itinerant merchants.

But we are going to need a tool to help us ... 

### Task-o-matic

Yep, I already kind of made said tool :D ! [task-o-matic](https://task-o-matic.dev)

I'll write more about it in a future post ! but you already have plenty of content to go through on the site itself.

I made sure to generate a lot of docs and a couple tutorials so you can already give it a try if you'd like !

But in a nutshell, it helps you create PRDs, refine them , split into tasks and subtasks and finally wiring all that to your favorite AI harness !

### Let's get this rolling

For the AI to operate properly, we need a specific stack, that way, we limit hallucination !

#### Initialisation and bootstrapping

Task-o-matic uses (https://better-t-stack.dev) under the hood to bootstrap the stack so let's do that !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest init init --project-name tiny-till \
  --frontend tanstack-router \
  --backend none \
  --package-manager bun && cd tiny-till
```

Boom, a monorepo for Tiny-till ! Batteries included : tailwind, shadcn, build script and all :D

Why `init init` ? you might have missed the whole using AI to code whole projects, sometimes... it is not aesthetically pleasing, and you should learn not to care to much (is my take on that... or lazyness...)

You will need a .env file to configure the AI stack.

```ini
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter

AI_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk_123456azertPOIUY7890i58008
```

#### Document the requirements of your project

Now, we tell the AI what we want to do, but why would we limit ourselves to 1 ?

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd create \
  --ai-reasoning 4096 \
  --stream \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "mistralai/devstral-2512:free:free" \
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "minimax/minimax-m2.1;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "google/gemini-3-flash-preview;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  "i would like to build tiny-till,
  it will be a small web app, local first (for sparse internet connection) that serve as a very simple till for on the go seller, farmers markets stall, etc...
  the idea came from me watching my baker who does delivery tour twice a week. she is always fighting here calculator to make the tally and she gromle about it a lot
  the idea wwould be only a few screens : 
  - product management (add/remove product, name+price (img optional) ) : a list with action buttons, + or edit happen inline (+ at the top)
  - a tally page : grid of product for fast and easy access (row of 2 or 3 for mobile, 4 to 6 on tablet, normal/compact variant, control by setting)
    - clicking on a product adds it to the count
    - number of this product added appear in the card, click on it trigger an input field to enter value with a remove button
  - a setting page : theme, display, import/export catalog
  No saving, it is purely done too calculate the price and is not meant for accounting purposes
  i am using tanstack-router and the project is already set up with tailwind css typescript and shadcnUI"
```

Am I using free endpoints for "real" work ? Yes, yes I am ! Does it distort my views on how much AI work should cost ? ... Why would it ? No, no, you just being a killjoy right now !

#### Petrol is not the only thing that needs refining !

A few minutes later... I got myself this (`cat .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md`)[/assets/blackhole/from-ralph-to-eric/prd-master.md] it doesn't really need more questions, but let's see what Claude has to say, shall we ?

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd question  --stream \
  --file .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md \
  --ai-model anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet --ai-reasoning 1500
```

Well, let's answer those... some are pertinant ! I guess that's why we bring out the big guns !

Let's reply !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd refine  --stream\
  --file .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md \
  --ai-model anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet --ai-reasoning 1500 \
  --output .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master-refined.md \
  --questions prd-questions.json
```

Questions are asked interactivelly ;)

```markdown
"The PRD mentions using Zustand with persist middleware for the Catalog, but also specifies IndexedDB as the storage layer. Should Zustand's persist middleware be configured to use IndexedDB directly, or will there be a custom sync layer between Zustand and IndexedDB? This affects how image blobs are handled since Zustand persist middleware typically works best with serializable data."

yes, configure Zustand's persist middleware to use IndexedDB directly.
```

```markdown
"For the 'Tap Badge to manually enter quantity' feature, what should happen if a user enters invalid input (negative numbers, decimals, non-numeric characters, or zero)? Should zero be treated as 'remove from cart' or should it maintain the item with 0 quantity until explicitly removed?",

zero should be treated as 'remove from cart'.
```

```markdown
"The PRD states the tally is 'transient' and held in memory, yet also mentions using sessionStorage. Given that sessionStorage persists across page refreshes within the same tab, this conflicts with the 'privacy and simplicity' goal of resetting on refresh. Should the tally truly reset on refresh (pure memory), or should it survive accidental refreshes during a transaction (sessionStorage)?",

no persistance, this is not for accounting and should only be in memory, when a new tally starts, the previous one does not exist anymore.
```

```markdown
"With TanStack Router's file-based routing, how should the navigation structure be organized? Specifically, should the Tally Page be the root route ('/'), and if users are on the Settings or Catalog management page when they refresh, should they be automatically redirected back to the Tally Page to prevent data loss confusion?",

yes, / is the tally page, yes redirect to tally page.
```

```markdown
"The image upload feature is marked as 'optional' for products, but the PRD recommends 'no images for MVP' in the risk mitigation. Should image upload functionality be completely excluded from MVP (Phase 1-5), or should the data model and UI be built to accommodate images even if the upload feature is disabled/hidden initially?",

no, i want images, just inforce a strict size limitation, 128*128 px, this is not meant to be a full image gallery, just a thumbnail for display, future improvement maybe to try and resize/optimise bigger image directly on device...but not in MVP !
```

```markdown
"For the Import/Export catalog feature, what should happen when importing a JSON file that contains product IDs that conflict with existing products? Should it merge (overwrite matching IDs), append (create duplicates), or prompt the user to choose? Also, should the import validate the JSON schema and handle corrupt/invalid files gracefully?",

overwrite and yes, must validate.
```

```markdown
"The 'Compact vs Normal' view toggle affects card size, but how should this interact with the responsive column count? For example, if a tablet user sets 6 columns in Normal view, should switching to Compact view automatically increase columns (e.g., to 8) to utilize the space savings, or should column count remain fixed per the user's explicit setting?",

yes, auto increase, 'tis why we want compact !
```

```markdown
"Given the Turborepo setup mentioned in the stack, is this application intended to be part of a monorepo with potential future packages (e.g., a companion admin dashboard, analytics service)? If so, should the data models and storage utilities be architected in a shared package from the start, or is this truly a standalone application for now?"

no, single package for now, we'll see later for the rest. let's keep it simple for now.
```

Well, this little stunt just costed me a nice 15 cts, more or les 10x more than the first PRD generation...

I don't know what is the most amazing... that 

* 1 call costs more than the 10 previous, 
* I can complain about a 2 days worth of work document cost 15 cents for only a few seconds of work !
* a document worth 2 of my days of work costs 15 cents to produce...in only a few seconds...

I haven't decided yet...anywooooooo, time to move on and not get siderated !

#### Touching up and go

When i said seconds, i lied, I spent 5 minutes editing the file. to fix lib versions, marked install and config work as done, and, finally, set expectation for the design.

the last thing we have to do, is ask an AI to split into main tasks.

once again, i wont only do 1, but this time, I'll ask Claude to be the final task creator, from others input !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd parse  --ai-reasoning 4096 --stream \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096"\
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet;reasoning=4096"
```

And there goes another 8.2 cents burnt for the token Gods, but in return, we get a detailed breakdown of the tasks required to complete the project !

We still have to split those tasks though... To make them more palatable for the current crop of AI models ! 

You should really consider reviewing the tasks in detail before spliting, not vibe planning like a muppet ! (guess what I did ^^)

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest tasks split  --all --stream \
  --reasoning 4096 \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096"\
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet;reasoning=4096"
```

I think Claude is not necessary here, but I had me $3 of openrouter credit i have to burn before the end of the month soooooo... big guns it is !

Burnt a tenth of that ! but now... we are actually ready ! Almost...

#### AGENTS.md

Or CLAUDE, or GEMINI, depends on your harness of choice, For me, it is opencode i'am going to run the /init prompt in opencode !

```bash
opencode run "/init"
```

it is not mandatory, but it is a good way to prevent dumb mistake and set some proper behavior regarding a few things, for me, i'll add the following

* Not to run the dev server
* not start background/long running processes
* not to use `:any`, `as any` or `any` as type, I want a typesafe codebase
* before claiming success, `bun run check-types` and `bun run build` must both succeed
* to fix LSP error when they happen
* use shadcn component has much as possible
* stay DRY and prefer creating custom components and utilities than repeat code
* use adapted skills when possible (frontend-design skill is mandatory when working on the frontend)
* that it is a static app project that will be hosted on github pages
* to use Context7 MCP in case more documentation or up to date documentation is needed (as the knowledge is certainly behind because of cutoff training date)

```bash
opencode run "Add the following to the AGENTS.md, remove any conflicting instructions you created, these take precedence : 
* Not to run the dev server
* not start background/long running processes
* not to use `:any`, `as any` or `any` as type, I want a typesafe codebase
* before claiming success, `bun run check-types` and `bun run build` must both succeed
* to fix LSP error when they happen
* use shadcn component has much as possible
* stay DRY and prefer creating custom components and utilities than repeat code
* use adapted skills when possible (frontend-design skill is mandatory when working on the frontend)
* that it is a static app project that will be hosted on github pages
* to use Context7 MCP in case more documentation or up to date documentation is needed (as the knowledge is certainly behind because of cutoff training date)" -c
```

I might add more as the agent works if i see reccuring errors and dumb things happening

#### Time to let Eric loose...

Well, guys, stash your parents away cause we are going to let Eric go at it !

Because I am El CheapoDev DelBrokeCasa, i am going to use my GLM coding plan to code, that way, i wont break the bank and it is OK enough for something like that i think !

If you'd rather use claude code, use the `--tool claude` option. (or codex/gemini/kilo) but opencode is nicer as it stream the content out (in part at least) so you see what is happening !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest tasks execute-loop --include-prd \
  --plan --plan-model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --review --review-model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --validate "npm run check-types && npm run build"
```

And now, you wait, coffee, snacks, more coffee, diner and breakfast probably, it gonna take a while ^^

## What do you think ? Where do we go from here ?

So that's the end (of this article) ! What do you think ? did you try a similar technique ? What's the plan next, cause...

If you are interested, the repo can be found on [github](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/tiny-till)
10:T4479,
Je vais pas re-introduire le concept de Ralph loop, si vous avez été a côté de l'IA dans la première moitié de janvier 2026, vous en avez entendu parler ! Si non, vous devriez aller voir la vidéo de Theo (ou quelqu'un d'autre mais celle-la est bonne !)

Vous savez probablement quel personnage de comics Ralph référence, mais Eric... ca pourrait être qui ?

Si vous avez pensé petit, gros et en colère, vous avez raison ! Je parle bien sûr d'Eric Cartman de South Park !

Alors que Ralph est naïf et innocent, Eric est calculateur et manipulateur. Pas quelque chose que je chercherais chez un humain, mais pour gérer un tas d'IA ? OUAIS DEFINITIVEMENT !

## La boucle Eric

Une idée, même si elle est bonne, a toujours besoin de travail et d'allers-retours pour être implémentée. Donc on expose d'abord l'idée à l'IA pour avoir un Product Requirements Document (PRD) et on travaille dessus !

Comment ca, lire ? Et bhe oui, il faut d'abord lire ! et tout de suite mettre à jour les parties avec lesquelles vous n'êtes pas d'accord ou les choses qui doivent être plus approfondies !

Une fois que c'est fait, demandez aux modèles d'IA de vous poser des questions sur le PRD et donnez tout ça, le PRD et vos réponses, à une autre IA pour la mise à jour.

Rincez, Répétez, jusqu'à ce que vous soyez satisfait du document.

Vous pouvez même faire traiter le PRD par plusieurs modèles pour ensuite comparer et fusionner les résultats, en utilisant l'IA, bien sûr :D

C'est là qu'on commence à diverger de la boucle Ralph de base. Au lieu de juste passer ça à l'IA et espérer que les tâches seront bien implémentées, on fait pré-découper et formaliser les tâches et sous-tâches en une liste par une IA !

L'écart grandit encore plus car on sépare l'implémentation des tâches en plusieurs étapes avec :
* une phase de planification qui analyse les requis pour les tâches, le code existant, et fait les recherches nécessaires
* une phase d'exécution pour faire le travail réel
* une phase optionnelle de vérification automatisée (check types, build, tests, ...) avec feedback automatique vers la phase d'exécution en cas d'erreurs
* une phase de review des résultats, qui peut renvoyer vers la phase d'exécution pour plus de raffinement.

Une fois tout ça fait ? la boucle Eric continue pour la phase suivante du plan, tout comme Ralph !

## Mais, Pourquoi... ?

La séparation des préoccupations !

Oui les modèles sont devenus plus intelligents, mais si vous avez joué avec des sub-agents et des skills, vous savez que le prompting n'est pas mort (pour le moment...)

Avoir une séparation propre comme ça aide à avoir de meilleurs prompts pour chaque phase de l'exécution des tâches.

Comme effet secondaire, ça signifie que vous pouvez contrôler quel modèle est utilisé pour quelle phase, peut-être que vous n'avez pas besoin d'Opus tout le long si ça a fait un super plan !

## A quoi ça ressemblerait ?

On va créer un petit projet à partir d'une idée que j'ai, vous pouvez le faire aussi si vous voulez !

Il s'appelle Tiny-till, une petite app pour avoir une caisse simple pour marchands ambulants.

Mais on va avoir besoin d'un outil pour nous aider ...

### Task-o-matic

Ouais, j'ai déjà en gros fait l'outil en question :D ! [task-o-matic](https://task-o-matic.dev)

J'écrirai plus à ce sujet dans un futur post ! mais vous avez déjà pas mal de contenu à parcourir sur le site lui-même.

J'ai fait gaffe à générer plein de docs et quelques tutoriels pour que vous puissiez déjà essayer si vous voulez !

Mais en gros, ça aide à créer des PRDs, les raffiner, découper en tâches et sous-tâches et finalement connecter tout ça à votre outil de code assité d'IA préféré !

### Allons-y

Pour que l'IA opère proprement, on a besoin d'une stack spécifique, comme ça, on limite les hallucinations !

#### Initialisation et bootstrap

Task-o-matic utilise (https://better-t-stack.dev) en interne pour bootstrap la stack donc faisons ça !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest init init --project-name tiny-till \
  --frontend tanstack-router \
  --backend none \
  --package-manager bun && cd tiny-till
```

Boum, un monorepo pour Tiny-till ! Batteries incluses : tailwind, shadcn, script de build et tout :D

Pourquoi `init init` ? vous avez peut-être raté toute l'histoire de l'IA qui code des projets entiers, parfois... c'est pas esthétique, et vous devriez apprendre à pas trop y faire attention (c'est mon avis la-dessus... ou de la flemme...)

Vous aurez besoin d'un fichier .env pour configurer la stack IA.

```ini
AI_PROVIDER=openrouter

AI_MODEL=nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free

OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk_123456azertPOIUY7890i58008
```

#### Documenter les requis de votre projet

Maintenant, on dit à l'IA ce qu'on veut faire, mais pourquoi se limiter à 1 ?

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd create \
  --ai-reasoning 4096 \
  --stream \

```

J'utilise des endpoints gratuits pour du "vrai" travail ? Oui, oui, je fais ! Est-ce que ça fausse ma vision de combien le travail IA devrait coûter ? ... pourquoi ça ferait ça ? Non, non, vous êtes juste en train de gâcher la fête là !

#### L'essence n'est pas la seule chose qui doit être raffinée !

Quelques minutes plus tard... je me suis récupéré ça (`cat .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md`)[/assets/blackhole/from-ralph-to-eric/prd-master.md] ça a pas vraiment besoin de plus de questions, mais voyons ce que Claude a a dire, d'accord ?

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd question  --stream \
  --file .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md \
  --ai-model anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet --ai-reasoning 1500
```

Bon, répondons à ça... certaines sont pertinentes ! je suppose que c'est pour ça qu'on sort les gros canons !

Répondons !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd refine  --stream\
  --file .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master.md \
  --ai-model anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet --ai-reasoning 1500 \
  --output .task-o-matic/prd/prd-master-refined.md \
  --questions prd-questions.json
```

Les questions sont posées interactivement ;)

```markdown
"The PRD mentions using Zustand with persist middleware for the Catalog, but also specifies IndexedDB as the storage layer. Should Zustand's persist middleware be configured to use IndexedDB directly, or will there be a custom sync layer between Zustand and IndexedDB? This affects how image blobs are handled since Zustand persist middleware typically works best with serializable data."

oui, configurer le middleware persist de Zustand pour utiliser IndexedDB directement.
```

```markdown
"For the 'Tap Badge to manually enter quantity' feature, what should happen if a user enters invalid input (negative numbers, decimals, non-numeric characters, or zero)? Should zero be treated as 'remove from cart' or should it maintain the item with 0 quantity until explicitly removed?",

zéro doit être traité comme 'retirer du panier'.
```

```markdown
"The PRD states the tally is 'transient' and held in memory, yet also mentions using sessionStorage. Given that sessionStorage persists across page refreshes within the same tab, this conflicts with the 'privacy and simplicity' goal of resetting on refresh. Should the tally truly reset on refresh (pure memory), or should it survive accidental refreshes during a transaction (sessionStorage)?",

pas de persistance, c'est pas pour la comptabilité et ça doit être uniquement en mémoire, quand un nouveau tally commence, le précédent n'existe plus.
```

```markdown
"With TanStack Router's file-based routing, how should the navigation structure be organized? Specifically, should the Tally Page be the root route ('/'), and if users are on the Settings or Catalog management page when they refresh, should they be automatically redirected back to the Tally Page to prevent data loss confusion?",

oui, / est la page tally, oui rediriger vers la page tally.
```

```markdown
"The image upload feature is marked as 'optional' for products, but the PRD recommends 'no images for MVP' in the risk mitigation. Should image upload functionality be completely excluded from MVP (Phase 1-5), or should the data model and UI be built to accommodate images even if the upload feature is disabled/hidden initially?",

non, je veux les images, imposez juste une limitation de taille stricte, 128*128 px, c'est pas fait pour être une galerie d'images complète, juste une miniature pour l'affichage, amélioration future peut-être pour essayer de redimensionner/optimiser des images plus grosses directement sur l'appareil...mais pas en MVP !
```

```markdown
"For the Import/Export catalog feature, what should happen when importing a JSON file that contains product IDs that conflict with existing products? Should it merge (overwrite matching IDs), append (create duplicates), or prompt the user to choose? Also, should the import validate the JSON schema and handle corrupt/invalid files gracefully?",

écraser et oui, doit valider.
```

```markdown
"The 'Compact vs Normal' view toggle affects card size, but how should this interact with the responsive column count? For example, if a tablet user sets 6 columns in Normal view, should switching to Compact view automatically increase columns (e.g., to 8) to utilize the space savings, or should column count remain fixed per the user's explicit setting?",

oui, augmentation auto, c'est pour ça qu'on veut compact !
```

```markdown
"Given the Turborepo setup mentioned in the stack, is this application intended to be part of a monorepo with potential future packages (e.g., a companion admin dashboard, analytics service)? If so, should the data models and storage utilities be architected in a shared package from the start, or is this truly a standalone application for now?",

non, package unique pour l'instant, on verra après pour le reste. gardons ça simple pour l'instant.
```

Bon, cette petite astuce vient de me coûter un joli 15 cts, plus ou moins 10x plus que la première génération de PRD...

Je sais pas ce qui est le plus incroyable... que

* 1 appel coûte plus que les 10 précédents,
* je puisse me plaindre qu'un document de 2 jours de travail coûte 15 cents pour seulement quelques secondes de travail !
* un document qui vaut 2 de mes jours de travail coûte 15 cents à produire...en seulement quelques secondes...

J'ai pas encore décidé...bon bref, passons à la suite et restons pas bloqués !

#### Les petites retouches et c'est parti

Quand j'ai dit secondes, j'ai menti, j'ai passé 5 minutes à éditer le fichier. pour fixer les versions de lib, marquer le travail d'install et de config comme fait, et, enfin, définir les attentes pour le design.

la dernière chose qu'on a a faire, c'est demander à une IA de découper en tâches principales.

encore une fois, je vais pas en faire qu'une seule, mais cette fois, je vais demander à Claude d'être le créateur de tâches final, à partir des entrées des autres !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest prd parse  --ai-reasoning 4096 --stream \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096"\
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet;reasoning=4096"
```

Et voila encore 8.2 cents brûlés en offrandes aux dieux du token, mais en retour, on a un découpage détaillé des tâches requises pour finir le projet !

On a encore à découper ces tâches par contre... Pour les rendre plus digérables, même pour les meilleurs modèles IA à l'heure actuelle !

Ca serait une bonne idée de revoir les tâches en détail avant de les découper, pas faire du vibe-planning comme un neuneu ! (devinez ce que j'ai fait ^^)

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest tasks split  --all --stream \
  --reasoning 4096 \
  --ai "xiaomi/mimo-v2-flash:free;reasoning=4096"\
  --ai "nvidia/nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free;reasoning=4096" \
  --ai "z-ai/glm-4.7;reasoning=4096" \
  --combine-ai "anthropic/claude-4.5-sonnet;reasoning=4096"
```

Je pense pas que Claude soit nécessaire là, mais j'avais mes $3 de crédit openrouter à brûler avant la fin du mois donc bon... on sort l'artillerie lourde !

Et bim, 30 centimes de plus ! mais maintenant... on est vraiment prêts ! Presque...

#### AGENTS.md

Ou CLAUDE, ou GEMINI, dépend de votre outil de code assité préféré, Pour moi, c'est opencode je vais lancer le prompt /init dans opencode !

```bash
opencode run "/init"
```

c'est pas vraiment obligatoire, mais c'est quand meme une bonne histoire d'eviter les plus grosse conneries et de recentrer quelques comportements pour certaines choses, du coup, on rajoute ca :

* Pas lancer le server de dev
* pas démarrer de processus en arrière-plan/de longue durée
* pas utiliser `:any`, `as any` ou `any` comme type, je veux une base de code typesafe
* avant de dire "Jai finiiiii", `bun run check-types` et `bun run build` doivent tous les deux réussir
* corriger les erreurs LSP quand elles arrivent
* utiliser les composants shadcn autant que possible
* rester DRY et préférer créer des composants personnalisés et des utilitaires que répéter du code
* utiliser les compétences adaptées quand c'est possible (la compétence frontend-design est obligatoire quand on travaille sur le frontend)
* que c'est un projet d'app statique qui sera hébergé sur github pages
* utiliser Context7 MCP au cas où plus de documentation ou une documentation à jour est nécessaire (car la connaissance est certainement en retard à cause de la date limite de training)

```bash
opencode run "Add the following to the AGENTS.md, remove any conflicting instructions you created, these take precedence :
* Not to run the dev server
* not start background/long running processes
* not to use `:any`, `as any` or `any` as type, I want a typesafe codebase
* before claiming success, `bun run check-types` and `bun run build` must both succeed
* to fix LSP error when they happen
* use shadcn component has much as possible
* stay DRY and prefer creating custom components and utilities than repeat code
* use adapted skills when possible (frontend-design skill is mandatory when working on the frontend)
* that it is a static app project that will be hosted on github pages
* to use Context7 MCP in case more documentation or up to date documentation is needed (as the knowledge is certainly behind because of cutoff training date)" -c
```

J'ajouterai peut-être plus pendant que l'agent travaille si je vois des erreurs récurrentes et des gourdineries qui arrivent trop souvent (... si je regarde passer le train... c'est pas dit XD)

#### Et maintenant, on fait rouler Eric...

Bon les gars, cachez vos parents car on va laisser Eric y aller !

Parce que je suis El CheapoDev DelBrokeCasa, je vais utiliser mon GLM coding plan pour coder, comme ça, je vais pas eclater ma tirelire et c'est assez intelligent pour un truc comme ça je pense !

Si vous préférez claude code, utilisez l'option `--tool claude`. (ou codex/gemini/kilo) mais opencode est plus sympa car il stream le contenu (en partie en tout cas) donc vous voyez ce qui se passe (meuuuuh !) !

```bash
npx task-o-matic@latest tasks execute-loop --include-prd \
  --plan --plan-model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --review --review-model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.7 \
  --validate "npm run check-types && npm run build"
```

Et maintenant, vous attendez, un café, un gouter, un peu plus de café, le dîner et pis le p'tit déj probablement, ça va prendre un moment ^^

## Vous en pensez quoi ? On va où après ?

Donc c'est la fin (de cet article) ! Vous en pensez quoi ? vous avez essayé une technique similaire ? C'est quoi le plan après, parce que bon, vu comme c'est parti...

Si vous êtes intéressés, le repo peut être trouvé sur [tiny-till github](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/tiny-till)

et pour [task-o-matic](https://task-o-matic.dev) vous trouverez [le repo ici](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic)
11:T11ee,
Hello everyone, I’d like to introduce LiteChat, a project I created.

[Repository](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat) and download link [here](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases) (available in French, English, Spanish, Italian, and German).

LiteChat is an AI chat application I built to interact with both local and remote LLMs—all within your browser. It’s designed with a "local-first" philosophy, requiring only an HTTP server to run, with everything else handled in your browser! No tracking, no accounts—you bring your own API keys. Data is saved in an IndexedDB database, and you can synchronize your conversations using Git.

Yes, entirely in the browser! 😛 To make this work, I also implemented a virtual file system (again, all in the browser). You can clone repos and include files from the VFS in your conversations! But manually selecting files was tedious, so I integrated tools for managing the VFS and Git.

With the core architecture in place, I added support for HTTP MCP servers. However, standard stdio servers were still missing, so I also built a bridge (rewritten by AI from `mcp-proxy`) to make them work (you can deploy it anywhere, but it’s not secure!).

Sure, AI is fun, but I was getting tired of text-only interactions. So, I added support for Mermaid diagrams and HTML forms (now you don’t even need to think about how to phrase your requests!). Sure, Mermaid diagrams aren’t the prettiest, but since I added a workflow module with visualizations based on [reactflow.dev](https://reactflow.dev), I also included a way for LLMs to generate them! And since plain text isn’t very engaging, there’s also a "Beat" block that uses [strudel.cc](http://strudel.cc/) to add auditory feedback.

Testing was getting repetitive, so I created a prompt library with templates—now you just fill in a form! (Okay, maybe I also needed it for workflows…)

What’s an Agent, you ask? It’s a system prompt, tools, and task-specific prompts! So, you also get a library for those.

Prompts and agents can integrate into workflows (that’s what they’re designed for!), but you also have transformation steps, user code execution, and custom prompts to facilitate transitions.

As you might have guessed, if I have a way to execute code in workflows, why not run AI-generated code? Yes, you can! In Python or JavaScript. And if you’re feeling adventurous, you can run JavaScript in "unsafe" mode (`eval` and all—that’s code for "yolo" 😆). This can produce cool stuff, like [this one-shot Three.js scroll shooter](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html). You can export it in one click (the template is a bit ugly, but I’ll improve it!).

To avoid losing context, all these UI blocks can be "activated" (or rather, suggested) using rules. Of course, you can add your own rules! There’s even a button to ask the AI to pick the best ones for your current prompt.

You also get the usual regenerate (with a different model if you like) and forking options. You can even edit responses manually to remove unnecessary parts. Code blocks are also editable with syntax highlighting for common languages (but no autocompletion or fancy features—let’s not push grandma into the bushes!).

To top it all off, you can organize AI "races" with an unlimited number of participants (though that depends on your budget, haha). It’s great for benchmarking or seeing which model will replace us first. I even built a small tool that takes exported race conversations and turns them into a benchmark site (currently more focused on the JS execution block: [https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html) for the "game" mentioned earlier).

I’m sure I forgot a few things, but you’ve got the gist! 😊

The hosted version is on GitHub Pages, with no tracking and no accounts! You bring your own API keys. You probably won’t be able to use the hosted version for your local LLM due to HTTPS/HTTP restrictions, but as I said, you can [download it](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases) and host it with a simple HTTP server. There are also localized versions for French, Italian, German, and Spanish. A short (and incomplete) tutorial playlist if you’re feeling lost: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Doe56gCsNRdNyfetOYPQw_JkPHO3XVh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Doe56gCsNRdNyfetOYPQw_JkPHO3XVh)

I hope you enjoy it, and constructive feedback is greatly appreciated! 😊

12:T156f,
Salut a tous, pour mon premier post, je vous presente LiteChat dont je sui le créateur.

[Repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat) et ici [pour télécharger](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases) (en francais, anglais, espagnol, italien et allemand).



C’est un chat IA que j’ai créé pour pouvoir utiliser des LLM locaux et distant, le tout dans votre navigateur. Il est conçu pour être “local first” et n’a besoin que d’un serveur HTTP pour fonctionner, tout le reste c’est dans votre navigateur ! Pas de tracking, pas de compte, vous venez avec vos clé d’API ! Les données sont sauvegardées dans une base de données IndexeDB et vous pouvez synchroniser vos conversations en utilisant git.

Oui, dans le navigateur :P Pour ce faire, j’ai aussi dû implémenter un système de fichiers virtuel (oui, toujour dans le navigateur en utilisant ). Vous avez donc accès aux deux, tant qu’a faire ! Vous pouvez cloner un repo et joindre des fichiers du VFS dans vos conversations !

Mais comme la sélection manuelle des fichiers, c’était une corvée, j’ai intégré des outils pour le VFS et git !

Ensuite, comme l’architecture de base était là, et bien j’ai ajouté le support des serveurs MCP HTTP, mais il manquait toujours les serveurs stdio …, donc j’ai aussi “fait” un bridge (réécrit par l’IA à partir de mcp-proxy ) pour les utiliser (vous pouvez le déployer où vous voulez mais ce n’est pas sécurisé !)

Apres, c’est bien mignon l’IA, mais j’en avais un peu marre du texte seul, du coup, j’ai ajouté le support des diagrammes Mermaid et des formulaires HTML (Comme ca on a meme plus besoin de réfléchir a quoi lui dire a la machine !). Bon… après…les diagrammes Mermaid c’est un peu moche, et comme j’ai ajouté un module de workflow avec des visualisations basée sur [https://reactflow.dev/], j’ai aussi ajouté un moyen pour les LLM de vous en créer ! Et puis comme le text ca fait pas beaucoup de bruit, il y a aussi in block “Beat” qui utilise (http://strudel.cc/) pour aussi en profiter de maniere auditive !

Et puis bon, en testant, toujours taper les mêmes prompts avec juste quelques différences c’était lourd aussi, j’ai donc fait un module de bibliothèque de prompts avec des modèles pour qu’y ai plus qu’a remplir un formulaire ;) (peut etre aussi que j’en avais besoin pour les workflows…)

‘Pis, un Agents, c’est quoi ? hein ? bah un prompt système, des outils et des prompts spécifiques pour les tâches ! Donc ça aussi vous en avez une librairie !

Les prompts et les agents peuvent s’intégrer dans les workflows (duh, ils étaient faits pour ça !) mais vous avez aussi des étapes de “transformation”/exécution de code utilisateur/“prompt personnalisé” pour faciliter le transit !

Comme vous l’avez peut-être deviné, si j’ai une forme d’exécution de code pour les workflows, Est ce que je pourrais t’y donc pas faire tourner le code généré par l’IA, hein ? Eeeeh bha SI ! En Python ou JavaScript Et même que si vous ête un dinguo, vous pouvez faire tourner le js en mode “unsafe” (eval et yolo XD) du coup ca peut produire des trucs (comme ce one shot threejs scroll shooter ) que vous pouvez exporter en 1 clic (le template est moche mais je vais y travailler !)

Afin de n’pas completement obliterer le context, tous ces jolis blocs d’UI peuvent être “activés” (plutôt suggérés ^^) en utilisant des règles. Evidement, vous pouvez ajouter vos règles a vous ! Et meme que vous avez un bouton pour demander a l’IA de les choisir pour vous pour votre prompt actuel !

Bien sûr, vous avez les habituels regen (avec un modèle différent si le coeur vous en dis) et forking, mais vous pouvez aussi modifier une réponse a la main pour dégager l’inutile. D’ailleur, Les blocs de code sont aussi modifiable avec la coloration syntaxique pour les langages les plus courants, (mais pas d’auto-complétion ou autre truc de bogoss, on va pas poussez mémé dans les orties !).

Pour couronner le tout, vous pouvez organiser des courses d’IA avec un nombre illimité de participants (ca dependra de la profondeur de votre portefeuille :P). C’est cool pour faire des benchmarks ou quand on veut voir laquelle des machines prendra notre place en premier… J’ai même fait un petit outil qui prend une conversation de course exportée et qui crée un mini site de benchmark (plus ciblé sur le bloc d’exécution JS pour l’instant https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html pour le “jeu” d’avant)

J’oublie certainement quelques bricoles, mais vous avez compris l’essentiel ^^

La version hébergée est sur les pages GitHub et il n’y a pas de tracking, pas de compte ! Vous apportez vos propres clés API ! Vous ne pourrez probablement pas utiliser la version hébergée pour votre LLM local à cause des restrictions https/http, mais comme je l’ai dit, vous pouvez télécharger https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases et héberger avec un simple serveur HTTP. Vous avez même des versions localisées pour le français, l’italien, l’allemand et l’espagnol. Une petite playlist (très incomplète) de tutoriels si vous vous sentez un peu perdu https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Doe56gCsNRdNyfetOYPQw_JkPHO3XVh

J’espère que vous apprécierez et les commentaires constructifs sont grandement appréciés :D13:T1e1b,
_This content has been generated by GLM 4.7 AI model_

So, you know how everyone's benchmarking LLMs these days? Like, "oh look, this model scored 87.3% on this synthetic test suite" or whatever. Boring, right? I mean, who cares if a model can reverse a string perfectly when you'll never ask it to reverse a string in real life? 😛

That's why I built **RaceBench** — a benchmarking tool that actually tests something useful. How well different LLMs can write real, working JavaScript code. Not some "hello world" nonsense, but actual creative coding tasks — games, visualisations, interactive stuff you might actually want to build.

## The idea (because every project needs an origin story)

One day I was curious: if I ask different AI models to write the same game, which one would actually produce playable code? Not "technically correct but crashes on the third frame" code, but stuff you could run and enjoy.

So I created a benchmark where I ask models to build a 2D scroll shooter game using Three.js. Not exactly "easy mode" for an AI — it requires understanding 3D graphics, game loops, user input, and making everything work together without blowing up the browser. Spoiler: some models handle it beautifully, others... well, let's say it's educational to watch them try 😊

## What it actually does

RaceBench is a static HTML dashboard that displays results from testing various LLMs on JavaScript code generation. Here's the cool part:

- **Real-world benchmarking** — we test creative coding tasks, not synthetic "reverse this string" nonsense
- **Executable results** — every model's output can be run directly. See the code, click preview, judge for yourself
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** — not just "did it work?" We track prompt tokens, completion tokens, TTFT (time to first token), generation time, and success rate
- **Educational value** — compare how different models structure their code, their approaches to the same problem, and learn from the variety (even the bad ones!)

## How it works (the technical bits, minus the boring parts)

### The setup

Everything's static — pure HTML/CSS/JS with no backend. Deploy it anywhere. GitHub Pages? Sure. Netlify? Why not. Your Raspberry Pi at home? Absolutely. The whole thing weighs about as much as a small hamster 🐹

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/racebench.git

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (or your jungle site of choice)
# I mean, whatever floats your boat
```

### The test case

The benchmark uses a 2D scroll shooter game built with Three.js as the test scenario. Each model gets the same prompt and has to produce working code. We extract the last ````runjs` code block from each response (because models love to chat before giving you the goods, you know?).

### What we track

For each model, RaceBench captures:

- **Prompt tokens** — how much it needed to understand what we wanted
- **Completion tokens** — how verbose it got with the solution
- **TTFT** (Time To First Token) — responsiveness metrics
- **Generation time** — total time to produce the code
- **Success rate** — did it actually run? Or did it explode?

### The UI (because I care about aesthetics, surprisingly)

Nice dark mode UI that doesn't look like it was designed by a sysadmin in 2003. Two view modes:

- **Card grid** — pretty cards for each model with key metrics at a glance
- **Sortable table** — for when you want to data-nerd out and sort by TTFT or token count

Click any model and you get:
- Live preview (opens in a new tab, runs the actual code)
- Raw response view (see exactly what the model said)
- All the metrics broken down

## Versions (because software never ends)

### v1: The brave beginning

Tested 18 models. Learned a lot. Realised some models are impressively creative while others are... trying their best. Let's put it that way. 😛

### v2: The refinement

Narrowed it down to 10 models. Better metrics extraction. Cleaner UI. Still watching models struggle with Three.js in entertaining ways.

## Tech stack (kept it simple, you're welcome)

- **Node.js** — because JavaScript is life
- **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)** — styling without the build step headaches
- **Simple-Datatables** — for when you want sortable tables but don't want to write them yourself
- **Three.js (dynamic)** — loaded on demand for the live previews

Minimal dependencies. No complex build pipelines. Just works. I like that philosophy.

## The models (participants in the chaos)

We've tested a bunch of the big names:

- Claude Sonnet 4
- DeepSeek R1
- GPT-4.1
- Gemini 2.5
- Grok 4
- Kimi K2
- Qwen3
- ...and more

Each one brings its own personality to the code. Some are terse and efficient. Others are verbose and over-engineered. A few produce code that makes you question everything you know about software development. All educational in their own way 😊

## See it in action

Don't just take my word for it — go play with the actual dashboard:

**[Live Demo](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html)**

Click around. Run some code. See which model you'd want on your team. Spoiler: the answer might surprise you (or it might be exactly what you expect. LLMs are weird like that).

## What makes this different from other benchmarks?

I'm glad you asked (I know you didn't, but pretend you did) 😛

1. **Real tasks, not toy problems** — we test actual creative coding, not "sort this array" nonsense
2. **You can run the results** — not just a score, actual working code you can inspect and execute
3. **No server needed** — static HTML means you can host it anywhere or even run it locally
4. **Transparent metrics** — see exactly what we measured and how
5. **Educational** — compare approaches, learn patterns, see what works (and what definitely doesn't)

## What I learned (because building stuff teaches you things)

- Some models are surprisingly good at 3D graphics code
- Others clearly haven't seen many Three.js examples in their training
- TTFT doesn't always correlate with code quality
- Verbose models aren't necessarily better — sometimes they're just... chatty
- The best model depends on what you value: speed, efficiency, code clarity, or just getting something that runs

## Future plans (the "if I get around to it" section)

I'd like to:

- Add more test cases (different types of creative coding challenges)
- Test more models (new ones keep popping up like mushrooms)
- Improve the metrics (maybe add code quality scoring?)
- Add a "leaderboard" view for those who love rankings
- Maybe, possibly, contribute the data to some broader benchmark effort (if such a thing exists and wants this kind of real-world data)

But let's be honest — I'll probably add a new test case before I remember to do any of that. Priorities, right? 😊

## Wrapping up

RaceBench isn't trying to be the definitive AI benchmark. It's just me trying to answer a simple question: "Which AI writes the best JavaScript code for real projects?" And having fun seeing them all try.

If you find it useful, great. If you learn something from the different code styles, even better. If you just enjoy clicking through live previews of AI-generated games and thinking "wow, that actually works," then I've done my job.

Feel free to fork it, add your own models, test different prompts. The more data, the better. Just don't ask me which model is "best" — that depends on what you're building, your timeline, your budget, and probably the phase of the moon. LLMs are like that 😛

**GitHub:** [DimitriGilbert/racebench](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/racebench)

Now go race some models. May the best code win.

_Ce contenu a été généré par le modèle AI GLM 4.7 et not-ai-writer_

Alors, vous voyez comme tout le monde benchmarke des LLMs en ce moment ? Genre, "oh regarde, ce modèle a score 87,3% sur cette suite de tests synthétique" ou quoi que ce soit dans le genre. Ennuyeux, non ? Je veux dire, on s'en fiche de savoir si un modèle peut inverser une chaîne parfaitement quand on ne lui demandera jamais d'inverser une chaîne dans la vraie vie ? 😛

C'est pour ça que j'ai créé **RaceBench** — un outil de benchmark qui teste vraiment quelque chose d'utile. À quel point différents LLMs peuvent écrire du code JavaScript réel qui fonctionne. Pas des trucs de "hello world" nuls, mais de vraies tâches de code créatif — des jeux, des visualisations, des trucs interactifs que vous pourriez vraiment vouloir construire.

## L'idée (parce que tout projet a besoin d'une histoire d'origine)

Un jour j'étais curieux: si je demande à différents modèles d'IA d'écrire le même jeu, lequel produirait vraiment du code jouable ? Pas du code "techniquement correct mais qui plante à la troisième frame", mais des trucs qu'on pourrait lancer et apprécier.

Donc j'ai créé un benchmark où je demande aux modèles de construire un jeu de tir scroll 2D en utilisant Three.js. Pas vraiment "mode facile" pour une IA — ça demande de comprendre la 3D, les boucles de jeu, les entrées utilisateur, et de faire tout fonctionner ensemble sans faire exploser le navigateur. Spoiler: certains modèles gèrent ça magnifiquement, d'autres... enfin, disons que c'est éducatif de les essayer 😊

## Ce que ça fait vraiment

RaceBench est un dashboard HTML statique qui affiche les résultats de tests de divers LLMs sur la génération de code JavaScript. Voici la partie cool:

- **Benchmarking réel** — on teste des tâches de code créatif, pas des trucs synthétiques du genre "inverse cette chaîne"
- **Résultats exécutables** — la sortie de chaque modèle peut être lancée directement. Voyez le code, cliquez sur preview, jugez par vous-même
- **Analyse multi-dimensionnelle** — pas juste "ça a marché ?" On tracke les tokens de prompt, les tokens de complétion, le TTFT (temps jusqu'au premier token), le temps de génération, et le taux de succès
- **Valeur éducative** — comparez comment différents modèles structurent leur code, leurs approches au même problème, et apprenez de la variété (même des mauvais !)

## Comment ça marche (les bits techniques, moins les parties ennuyeuses)

### Le setup

Tout est statique — du HTML/CSS/JS pur sans backend. Déployez-le n'importe où. GitHub Pages ? Sûr. Netlify ? Pourquoi pas. Votre Raspberry Pi à la maison ? Absolument. Le tout pèse à peu près le poids d'un petit hamster 🐹

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/racebench.git

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (or your jungle site of choice)
# I mean, whatever floats your boat
```

### Le cas de test

Le benchmark utilise un jeu de tir scroll 2D construit avec Three.js comme scénario de test. Chaque modèle reçoit le même prompt et doit produire du code qui fonctionne. On extrait le dernier bloc de code ```runjs de chaque réponse (parce que les modèles adorent discuter avant de vous donner la marchandise, vous voyez ?).

### Ce qu'on tracke

Pour chaque modèle, RaceBench capture:

- **Prompt tokens** — combien il en a eu besoin pour comprendre ce qu'on voulait
- **Completion tokens** — à quel point il a été verbeux avec la solution
- **TTFT** (Time To First Token) — métriques de réactivité
- **Generation time** — temps total pour produire le code
- **Success rate** — ça a vraiment tourné ? Ou ça a explosé ?

### L'UI (parce que je me soucie de l'esthétique, étonnamment)

Une superbe interface dark mode qui n'a pas l'air d'avoir été conçue par un admin sys en 2003. Deux modes de vue:

- **Grille de cartes** — de belles cartes pour chaque modèle avec les métriques clés en un coup d'œil
- **Tableau triable** — pour quand vous voulez faire le data-nerd et trier par TTFT ou nombre de tokens

Cliquez sur n'importe quel modèle et vous obtenez:
- Live preview (s'ouvre dans un nouvel onglet, lance le vrai code)
- Vue de la réponse brute (voyez exactement ce que le modèle a dit)
- Toutes les métriques détaillées

## Versions (parce que le logiciel ne se termine jamais)

### v1: Le début courageux

Testé 18 modèles. Appris beaucoup. Réalisé que certains modèles sont impressionnamment créatifs tandis que d'autres sont... essaient leur meilleur. Mettons les choses comme ça. 😛

### v2: Le raffinement

Réduit à 10 modèles. Meilleure extraction des métriques. UI plus propre. Toujours à regarder les modèles galérer avec Three.js de manière amusante.

## Stack technique (gardé simple, de rien)

- **Node.js** — parce que JavaScript est la vie
- **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)** — du style sans les maux de tête de build
- **Simple-Datatables** — pour quand vous voulez des tableaux triables mais ne voulez pas les écrire vous-même
- **Three.js (dynamique)** — chargé à la demande pour les previews en direct

Dépendances minimales. Pas de pipelines de build complexes. Juste ça marche. J'aime cette philosophie.

## Les modèles (participants dans le chaos)

On a testé plein de grands noms:

- Claude Sonnet 4
- DeepSeek R1
- GPT-4.1
- Gemini 2.5
- Grok 4
- Kimi K2
- Qwen3
- ...et plus

Chacun apporte sa propre personnalité au code. Certains sont laconiques et efficaces. D'autres sont verbeux et sur-ingénierés. Quelques-uns produisent du code qui vous fait remettre en question tout ce que vous savez sur le développement logiciel. Tous éducatifs à leur manière 😊

## Voyez-le en action

Ne me croyez pas sur parole — allez jouer avec le vrai dashboard:

**[Démo Live](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html)**

Cliquez autour. Lancez du code. Voyez quel modèle vous voudriez dans votre équipe. Spoiler: la réponse pourrait vous surprendre (ou elle pourrait être exactement ce que vous attendez. Les LLMs sont bizarres comme ça).

## Ce qui rend ça différent des autres benchmarks ?

Je suis ravi que vous demandiez (je sais que vous n'avez pas demandé, mais faites semblant) 😛

1. **Vraies tâches, pas problèmes jouets** — on teste du code créatif réel, pas des trucs du genre "trie ce tableau"
2. **Vous pouvez lancer les résultats** — pas juste un score, du vrai code qui fonctionne que vous pouvez inspecter et exécuter
3. **Pas de serveur nécessaire** — HTML statique signifie que vous pouvez l'héberger n'importe où ou même le lancer localement
4. **Métriques transparentes** — voyez exactement ce qu'on a mesuré et comment
5. **Éducatif** — comparez les approches, apprenez des patterns, voyez ce qui marche (et ce qui ne marche DEFINITIVEMENT pas)

## Ce que j'ai appris (parce que construire des trucs vous apprend des choses)

- Certains modèles sont étonnamment bons en code graphique 3D
- D'autres n'ont clairement pas vu beaucoup d'exemples Three.js dans leur entraînement
- Le TTFT ne correlate pas toujours avec la qualité du code
- Les modèles verbeux ne sont pas nécessairement meilleurs — parfois ils sont juste... bavards
- Le meilleur modèle dépend de ce que vous valorisez: vitesse, efficacité, clarté du code, ou juste avoir quelque chose qui tourne

## Plans futurs (la section "si je m'y retrouve")

J'aimerais:

- Ajouter plus de cas de test (différents types de défis de code créatif)
- Tester plus de modèles (de nouveaux surgissent comme des champignons)
- Améliorer les métriques (peut-être ajouter un scoring de qualité du code ?)
- Ajouter une vue "leaderboard" pour ceux qui adorent les classements
- Peut-être, possiblement, contribuer les données à un effort de benchmark plus large (si un tel truc existe et veut ce genre de données du monde réel)

Mais soyons honnêtes — j'ajouterai probablement un nouveau cas de test avant de me souvenir de faire quoi que ce soit de tout ça. Les priorités, quoi ? 😊

## Conclusion

RaceBench n'essaie pas d'être le benchmark AI définitif. C'est juste moi qui essaie de répondre à une question simple: "Quelle IA écrit le meilleur code JavaScript pour des projets réels ?" Et m'amuse à les voir tous essayer.

Si vous le trouvez utile, super. Si vous apprenez quelque chose des différents styles de code, encore mieux. Si vous aimez juste cliquer à travers des previews en direct de jeux générés par IA et penser "wow, ça marche vraiment," alors j'ai fait mon boulot.

N'hésitez pas à le forker, ajouter vos propres modèles, tester différents prompts. Plus il y a de données, mieux c'est. Ne me demandez pas quel modèle est "le meilleur" — ça dépend de ce que vous construisez, votre timeline, votre budget, et probablement la phase de la lune. Les LLMs sont comme ça 😛

**GitHub:** [DimitriGilbert/racebench](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/racebench)

Maintenant allez faire la course à quelques modèles. Que le meilleur code gagne.

_This content has been generated by GLM 4.7 AI model_

So. Who here has **project ideas**? And among these ideas, some turn into... uh, actual tasks, right?

Ok ok, so, get me a structured plan, broken down tasks, and anything resembling order. Like, right NOW!

Yeah...it's ok. We've all been there 😛.

The wasteland of unorganized thoughts is a dangerous place. But worry not — I built us a bunker.

## Welcome to the Bunker 🏚️

[Task-O-Matic](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic) is an AI-powered task management system with a post-apocalyptic survival bunker theme (because why not?). It takes your chaotic project ideas and turns them into structured, executable task lists through AI assistance.

Think of it as your personal task commander in the aftermath of project anarchy.

## What it actually does 📋

Task-O-Matic isn't state of the art — I'm not a bloody AI researcher — but it *does* work. And it's rather useful for us bunker dwellers:

- **Idea to PRD** : Take your half-baked idea and let AI turn it into a proper Product Requirements Document
- **PRD to tasks** : Break that PRD into actual, doable tasks
- **AI-powered enhancement** : Let the AI improve, split, and plan your tasks
- **Multi-AI generation** : Run multiple AI models in parallel and compare results (battle royale style)
- **External tool integration** : Connect to Opencode, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and more
- **Benchmarking** : Test different AI models with git worktree isolation
- **Existing projects** : Attach Task-O-Matic to projects you already started (`init attach`)
- **Local-first** : Everything lives in `.task-o-matic` (the bunker's archives)
- **Hierarchical breakdown** : Subtasks, sub-subtasks, sub-sub-sub... you get the idea
- **Streaming responses** : Watch the AI think with reasoning tokens

## The tech stack 🔧

Built with tools that survived the apocalypse:

- **TypeScript** — type safety is survival safety
- **Bun** — fast (needed when running from generators)
- **Vercel AI SDK v6** — the magic behind the AI curtain
- **Commander.js** — CLI parsing (I know a thing or two about CLI tools...)
- **Inquirer.js** — interactive prompts (for bunker decisions)
- **Zod** — schema validation (don't want corrupted data in the archives)

## Quick start ⚡

Oh, I know you're impatient. (Me too...)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic
bun install
bun link
task-o-matic init attach
task-o-matic prd generate "Build a survival bunker dashboard"
task-o-matic prd parse
task-o-matic task enhance --all
task-o-matic task execute --ai claude
```

Done.

## Installation 🔨

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic
bun install
bun link
```

Or via npm if you prefer the old ways: `npm install -g @dimitrigilbert/task-o-matic`

## Configuration 🔑

Task-O-Matic needs API keys. Set them as environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Put these in `.env` or your shell profile. Don't commit them to git, obviously.

## How it works 🚀

### Initialize

```bash
task-o-matic init attach    # attach to existing project
task-o-matic init new my-project   # or create new
```

Creates a `.task-o-matic` directory. Like your bunker's storage room.

### Generate a PRD

```bash
task-o-matic prd generate "I want to build a personal finance tracker that works offline, syncs when online, and has dark mode because bunker lights are harsh"
```

The AI will interview you (via inquirer prompts) to clarify requirements and generate a proper PRD.

### Parse into tasks

```bash
task-o-matic prd parse
```

Breaks down your PRD into hierarchical tasks, subtasks, sub-subtasks. Organized by priority and dependencies.

### Enhance and plan

```bash
task-o-matic task enhance --all
task-o-matic task plan
task-o-matic task split --id task-123
```

### Execute

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --ai claude
task-o-matic task execute --all --ai claude,gemini,gpt4
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --tool opencode
```

The AI reads the task description and context, generates code or documentation. You review before committing.

## Multi-AI 🤖

Run multiple AI models in parallel:

```bash
task-o-matic task generate-multi \
  --id task-123 \
  --providers claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --compare
```

See different approaches. Verify the best solution. Like having a council of AI advisors in your bunker 😊

## Benchmarking 📊

```bash
task-o-matic benchmark run \
  --models claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --task-set my-tasks
task-o-matic benchmark results
task-o-matic benchmark compare --run-id run1,run2
```

Uses git worktrees. Clean environments. No contamination!

## Local-first storage 💾

Everything lives in `.task-o-matic/`:

```
.prds/           # Product Requirements Documents
tasks/          # Task definitions and status
history/        # Execution history
benchmarks/     # Benchmark results
config.json     # Your configuration
```

No cloud. No data leaving your bunker (unless you choose to). Your data, your rules.

## Streaming with reasoning tokens 🧠

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --stream
```

Shows reasoning tokens as they're generated. Fascinating to see how the AI approaches problems (sometimes in ways I wouldn't expect, which is good).

## Why the bunker theme? 🤔

I know, I know. It's weird. But here's the thing:

1. It's fun 😛
2. Projects feel like chaotic wastelands
3. A structured system feels like building a safe shelter
4. "Bunker" is a great metaphor for local-first, isolated development
5. Why not?

Also, calling users "citizens" and projects "missions" makes me chuckle. If it makes you smile too, then it's worth it.

## Current status 🚧

Task-O-Matic is at **v0.1.5-beta.1**. Things might break. Features might change. But the core functionality works.

If you find bugs (and I'm sure there are nests of them), open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic/issues). I'm the only user right now, so finding bugs is becoming... challenging 😊

## What's next? 🔮

- More AI provider integrations
- Web UI (because some people prefer graphical interfaces)
- Team collaboration (multi-bunker coordination)
- Plugin system for custom tools
- Better dependency visualization
- Task templates for common project types
- CI/CD integration

Subject to change based on what the wasteland throws at us.

## Get involved! 🤝

This is a side project I built because I needed it. If you find it useful, that's awesome. If you want to contribute, even better!

Star the repo. Open issues. Submit PRs. Share it with other bunker dwellers.

## Final thoughts 💭

Task-O-Matic isn't going to revolutionize project management or anything grand. It's just a tool I built to help me (and hopefully you) turn chaotic ideas into organized, executable tasks.

It's not perfect. It's not the most elegant code I've ever written. But it works. It's useful. And it's mine.

If you're drowning in project chaos and need a structured approach to breaking things down, give it a shot. Worst case, you'll have a cool CLI tool with a bunker theme.

Best case, you'll actually ship that project you've been thinking about for months.

Stay safe out there in the wasteland, citizen. And happy coding!

Alors. Qui ici a des **idées de projets** ? Et parmi ces idées, certaines se transforment en... euh, vraies tâches, non ?

Ok ok, alors, donnez-moi un plan structuré, des tâches détaillées, et tout ce qui ressemble à de l'ordre. Genre, MAINTENANT !

Ouais...c'est bon. On est tous passés par là 😛.

Le wasteland des pensées désorganisées est un endroit dangereux. Mais pas de souci — je nous ai construit un bunker.

## Bienvenue dans le Bunker 🏚️

[Task-O-Matic](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic) est un système de gestion de tâches propulsé par l'IA avec un thème de bunker de survie post-apocalyptique (parce que pourquoi pas ?). Il prend vos idées de projet chaotiques et les transforme en listes de tâches structurées et exécutables grâce à l'IA.

Considérez ça comme votre commandant de tâches personnel dans les suites d'une anarchie de projet.

## Ce que ça fait vraiment 📋

Task-O-Matic n'est pas state of the art — je suis pas un putain de chercheur en IA — mais ça *marche*. Et c'est plutôt utile pour nous, habitants de bunker :

- **Idée vers PRD** : Prenez votre idée à moitié cuite et laissez l'IA la transformer en un vrai Product Requirements Document
- **PRD vers tâches** : Découpez ce PRD en vraies tâches faisables
- **Amélioration propulsée par l'IA** : Laissez l'IA améliorer, diviser et planifier vos tâches
- **Génération multi-IA** : Lancez plusieurs modèles d'IA en parallèle et comparez les résultats (style battle royale)
- **Intégration d'outils externes** : Connectez-vous à Opencode, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, et plus
- **Benchmarking** : Testez différents modèles d'IA avec l'isolation git worktree
- **Projets existants** : Attachez Task-O-Matic à des projets que vous avez déjà commencés (`init attach`)
- **Local-first** : Tout vit dans `.task-o-matic` (les archives du bunker)
- **Découpage hiérarchique** : Sous-tâches, sous-sous-tâches, sous-sous-sous... vous voyez l'idée
- **Réponses en streaming** : Regardez l'IA réfléchir avec les tokens de raisonnement

## La stack technique 🔧

Construit avec des outils qui ont survécu à l'apocalypse :

- **TypeScript** — la sûreté des types, c'est la sûreté de survie
- **Bun** — rapide (nécessaire quand on fui les générateurs)
- **Vercel AI SDK v6** — la magie derrière le rideau IA
- **Commander.js** — parsing CLI (je sais un truc ou deux sur les outils CLI...)
- **Inquirer.js** — prompts interactifs (pour les décisions du bunker)
- **Zod** — validation de schéma (pas de données corrompues dans les archives)

- Démarrage rapide ⚡

Oh, je sais que vous êtes impatient. (Moi aussi...)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic
bun install
bun link
task-o-matic init attach
task-o-matic prd generate "Build a survival bunker dashboard"
task-o-matic prd parse
task-o-matic task enhance --all
task-o-matic task execute --ai claude
```

Voilà.

## Installation 🔨

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic
bun install
bun link
```

Ou via npm si vous préférez les vieilles méthodes : `npm install -g @dimitrigilbert/task-o-matic`

## Configuration 🔑

Task-O-Matic a besoin de clés API. Configurez-les comme variables d'environnement :

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-key"
```

Mettez ça dans `.env` ou votre profil de shell. Évidemment, les commit pas dans git.

## Comment ça marche 🚀

### Initialiser

```bash
task-o-matic init attach    # attacher à un projet existant
task-o-matic init new my-project   # ou en créer un nouveau
```

Crée un répertoire `.task-o-matic`. Comme la salle de stockage de votre bunker.

### Générer un PRD

```bash
task-o-matic prd generate "I want to build a personal finance tracker that works offline, syncs when online, and has dark mode because bunker lights are harsh"
```

L'IA va vous interviewer (via les prompts inquirer) pour clarifier les requis et générer un vrai PRD.

### Parser en tâches

```bash
task-o-matic prd parse
```

Découpe votre PRD en tâches hiérarchiques, sous-tâches, sous-sous-tâches. Organisées par priorité et dépendances.

### Améliorer et planifier

```bash
task-o-matic task enhance --all
task-o-matic task plan
task-o-matic task split --id task-123
```

### Exécuter

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --ai claude
task-o-matic task execute --all --ai claude,gemini,gpt4
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --tool opencode
```

L'IA lit la description de la tâche et le contexte, génère du code ou de la documentation. Vous reviewez avant de committer.

## Multi-IA 🤖

Lancez plusieurs modèles d'IA en parallèle :

```bash
task-o-matic task generate-multi \
  --id task-123 \
  --providers claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --compare
```

Voyez différentes approches. Vérifiez la meilleure solution. Comme avoir un conseil d'experts IA dans votre bunker 😊

## Benchmarking 📊

```bash
task-o-matic benchmark run \
  --models claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --task-set my-tasks
task-o-matic benchmark results
task-o-matic benchmark compare --run-id run1,run2
```

Utilise les git worktrees. Environnements propres. Pas de contamination !

## Stockage local-first 💾

Tout vit dans `.task-o-matic/` :

```
.prds/           # Product Requirements Documents
tasks/          # Définitions de tâches et statuts
history/        # Historique d'exécution
benchmarks/     # Résultats de benchmark
config.json     # Votre configuration
```

Pas de cloud. Pas de données qui quittent votre bunker (sauf si vous le choisissez). Vos données, vos règles.

## Streaming avec tokens de raisonnement 🧠

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --stream
```

Affiche les tokens de raisonnement au fur et à mesure qu'ils sont générés. Fascinant de voir comment l'IA aborde les problèmes (parfois de façons que je n'aurais pas attendues, ce qui est bon).

## Pourquoi le thème bunker ? 🤔

Je sais, je sais. C'est bizarre. mais voilà le truc :

1. C'est fun 😛
2. Les projets ressemblent à des wastelands chaotiques
3. Un système structuré ressemble à la construction d'un abri sûr
4. "Bunker" est une super métaphore pour le dev local-first et isolé
5. Pourquoi pas ?

Et puis, appeler les utilisateurs "citoyens" et les projets "missions" me fait pouffer. Si ça vous fait sourire aussi, alors ça en vaut la peine.

## Statut actuel 🚧

Task-O-Matic est en **v0.1.5-beta.1**. Des trucs peuvent casser. Des features peuvent changer. Mais la fonctionnalité core marche.

Si vous trouvez des bugs (et je suis sûr qu'il y a des nids), ouvrez une issue sur [GitHub](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic/issues). Je suis le seul utilisateur pour l'instant, donc trouver des bugs devient... challengeant 😊

## Et après ? 🔮

- Plus d'intégrations de providers IA
- Web UI (parce que certains préfèrent les interfaces graphiques)
- Collaboration d'équipe (coordination multi-bunker)
- Système de plugins pour outils custom
- Meilleure visualisation des dépendances
- Templates de tâches pour types de projets communs
- Intégration CI/CD

Sujet à changement selon ce que le wasteland nous balance.

## Impliquez-vous ! 🤝

C'est un side project que j'ai construit dont j'avais besoin. Si vous le trouvez utile, c'est awesome. Si vous voulez contribuer, encore mieux !

Star le repo. Ouvrez des issues. Soumettez des PRs. Partagez-le avec d'autres habitants de bunker.

## Pensées finales 💭

Task-O-Matic va pas révolutionner la gestion de projet ou quoi que ce soit de grand. C'est juste un outil que j'ai construit pour m'aider (et vous je l'espère) à transformer des idées chaotiques en tâches organisées et exécutables.

C'est pas parfait. C'est pas le code le plus élégant que j'aie jamais écrit. Mais ça marche. C'est utile. Et c'est le mien.

Si vous coulez dans le chaos de projet et avez besoin d'une approche structurée pour découper les choses, essayez-le. Dans le pire des cas, vous aurez un outil CLI cool avec un thème bunker.

Dans le meilleur des cas, vous livrerez enfin ce projet auquel vous pensez depuis des mois.

Restez prudents là-dehors dans le wasteland, citoyen. Et bon code !
