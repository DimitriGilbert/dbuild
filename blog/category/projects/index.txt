f:T2f74,
## Why ?

I looked for something like that and did not find any, so I am building one !

I will take this opportunity to build it in public, as much as possible ! Meaning most prompts and conversations will be available for you to read and "inspire" yourself !

Why not all conversations ? Well, sometimes, I forget, other times... I'm swearing way too much so it does not bring any value ! (I am grumpy and irritable as a default state, pain makes it worst... at the moment, the pain level oscillate between 2 and 5 out of 10 ^^)

I also want to show others that you can actually create something with AI doing most of the grunt work of dev with "careful" orchestration.

Is it going to be perfect ? XD what a stupid question ! NO ! 'f course not !

Can it get the job done ? I certainly hope so !

## What is it already ?

It is a library/marketplace of Shadcn ui components ! I was tired of hunting for cool components and blocks all around the internet !

Between github lackluster SEO and worst devs' website's one, it is really hard to come across new components, and it is a shame cause some are fantastic !

Also, as a creator of some component (with awful terrible SEOed sites...) i kind of feel unseen, sooo [cn-registry.dev](https://cn-registry.dev) was born !

## The process

Like I said, this is a build in public thing, so I am going to try and share what I learned with you (and my future self if this MF wants to listen !).

How I did things, what worked, what did not really do so, my fuck ups, hope and delusions...

In a sense, I am going to make mistake and look like a fool so you don't have to !

Let's start at the beginning...

### The Idea

Plenty of time I see people asking for ideas on things to build, to other humans, or worse, AI...

No... please don't ! not here !

I sincerely thing ideating is **The** thing that will separate us from machines for awhile still ! You should not delegate that !

"But how do I find ideas then ?" might you witty reader ask me ! And so rightful would you be !

So let me answer you with a question, that could trigger some ideation !

Are there no problem that need solving, in the place that you live in ?

Poetic rhymes aside, solve one of your damn fking problem man (or girl, you are welcome to do so too !) !

That way, even if you don't end up having clients, you'll have solved one of your problem !

For me the problem was "lazy ass dev want find shadcn components easy" ! There you go, how do you solve that problem ?!

### Initial plan

Nothing ground breaking or revolutionary, a dumb directory would do the trick... but that would lack a bit of flair... wouldn't it ?

Solving a simple problem does not necessarily mean a simplistic solution and I was already very keen on over-engineering my own tombstone sooo, let's go for that !

Why not sprinkle some social stuff on it ? It's not because I am limited regarding those skills that others are !

User account, likes, comments ! there you go ! Now we can socialise !

We have the basic Idea of what we want ? Yeah ?

Yeah ! Now we can go bother some AI with it !

### Start proompting

```
I want to build a website using nextjs 15 and shadcn  (i got the stack figured out !) and I need a complete plan to create the front end !
the project is called "cn-registry" and it will be a registry of shadcn components and tools, because hunting for them feels like a full time job.
I want you to plan the needed components and pages, I aim for maximum reusability so if something make sense standalone, it should be ! i do not want you to create code, just the plan !
I want a home page with carousels, one with the 10 latest components, one with the trending one
components will have a name, a description, a repo link, a website, an installation url, categories and each should have a dedicated page with the copiable install command, the repo readme and github info, some showcase with code toggles
Tools will be the same but the install url might be for an npm package or not exists
I want a search page with card or list results and filters on categories
same for tools but on a different page
I want to have a star rating system and user account where user can see the components they stared
User will be able to comment on components
```

As you can see, simple, (in)efficient, (de)organized ! And a couple refinement later, I have my intermediary prompt for V0 !

I wont bore you with the mile long prompt (you have convo link in repo ^^) but it was a good mile long and i did not change much !

Suffice to say that after that I had some "mock data stuffed" frontend prototype for... where am I going to put that... ?!!

### Select your stack

I already did, and you probably should think of that before proompting to be honest ! For me it was easy, I just reached for my current default stack Nextjs front and back, trpc, tailwind and shadcn.

Yes, it is boring. Yes, everyone is doing the same. I don't care.

I start a gazillion projects (and a half) every month cause I am unable to focus on one thing at a time, it doesn't mean I have the cognitive bandwidth to try and learn new stuff every times !

There is also plenty of good docs and resources for all these, which make it easy to work with without too much prior experience

Plus, as a massive, Massive (MASSIVE !) bonus : It works well with AI ! (mostly, sometimes)

Am I saying you should pick this stack ? If you like it, yes, otherwise, i couldn't care less !

Pick what you know, the new hyped stuff or what tickles your fancy ! Really, I couldn't care less, but I care for you to do it right ! Use [better-t-stack](https://better-t-stack.dev) !

yes, this is authoritative, but if your stack is in, use it ! 1 command, boom, project scaffolded and ready to go in seconds (thank me later)

### Let the music start !

```markdown
[x] Idea
[x] Concept
[x] project initialized
[x] frontend prototype
[ ] proper plan
```

Ooooh ? You thought... ? you thought I was going to open my favourite AI agent and start vibing away ?

no no no ! This is not the way ! You are going to go back to your first AI pal you used for the front end prototype plan and you are going to ask it for another plan !

```markdown
I am using the latest version of drizzle orm and postgres so i would like you to carefully plan the whole complete data model I will need,
including user setting and admin/creator utilities table tha migth be needed in the project. we will iterate to align with my goal but try to makee it very comphrehensive
```

It did a pretty good job with my previous frontend plan alignement in one shot soooo...

```
cd workspace/Code/cn-registry;
claude
"I want you to implement the server complete side of the project following this :
  **cn-registry Complete Data Model Plan**
...
  better auth is already setup and running,
  I want schema definition and trpc routes with complete access management for security.
  make sure the apps build when you are done with the backend.
"
```

Et en voiture Simone !

Realignment aside, this got me a building backend that I asked the agent to wire up to the frontend.

### Broken string and other misadventures...

Were you waiting for it ? To be completely honest, I did not think it was going to be so early...but yes, no plan survive contacts with the enemy.

Which enemy ? Trpc ! No no ! not trpc trpc, trpc version and the fact that a major revision came out between the training cut off date and the release/adoption of trpc version...

What does this mean ? AI follows patterns it "knows", guess what it does when it doesn't know the patterns ?

Yup, it's "hallucination time" baby ! Wooooooot Wooooooot ! -\_- Can you feel the pain ? ok, good.

But for a villain in the story, a Hero will come forward, you see

A hero to help the dragons slay, and its name is LLM dot txt

```markdown
my stack is using the following package.json files
Agents often fails on trpc usage because their knowledge is out of date.
I would like you to fetch the lates trpc docs and prepare a comprhensive but concise llm.txt for my agents to work with.
it is only destined towards LLM so you can forgo absolutely all the fluff and present information in the best possible way for you to ingest it efficiently
```

I fed the responded file to my agent, and behold, a few prompts later, I was served dragons' heart for dinner !

### more, More, MOOOOAR

Do you feel the power rising ? The exhileration of AI acceleration ? Is your brain broken and addicted yet ?

Nooo ? well, we are going to have to work on that ! Maybe it's because we lack documentation ?

You are very right ! So I asked gemini cli to do that !

Unfortunatly, i do not have this prompt anymore, but it went something like :

```
I am working on this project [description]
the front and backend are prototyped, the apps build but i did not test anything yet.
I would like you to analyze it very (very ! VERY !!) carefully !
you have to open many files to make sure you understand the app and how it is built.
once done, please create some documentation about that.
```

to which I invariably had to complement after the first response (exact paraphrasing)

```
oooOOOOH FFS ! HOW THE F DO YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING, YOU OPENED 5 FILES, 2 OF THEM WERE PACKAGE.JSON ! OPEN ALL THE FILES ! **ALL OF THEM**
```

Seriously, how does anyone work with gemini these days ? It ended up giving me some decent documentation after that flogging though !

What ? Why do I make the model document the thing already ?

```
Good. now that you have a complete understanding of the full project, i want you to create a plan to finish the implementation of the existing base.
then, I want you to create a plan in better.md that outlines possible enhancement to the base application.
One I want is a cart system so a user can add component to it and get a complete install command for all the components he selected.
be creative and come up with functionalities that would make this platform stand out
```

There you go, this is why ! now that you have something more than a couple of sentence, agents can stretch their legs !

What do similar enough architectures and software have as functionalities ? It will know ! You'll be left with the cherry picking and it might even give you more ideas !

### Tidy up and go forward

Armed with gemini's assertion of the codebase, I asked claude to do the work (you would have to pay me to allow gemini modifying my files !)

Once complete I asked it to create a proper plan for the extra functionalities I chose

- cart system
- project system
- github integration
- creator profiles

It gracefully did that while I started testing the app. Systematic clicking and typing, going from error to error, indexing them by small groups, asking my agent to take care of them.

This is the perfect occasion to start having a look at the code... yes, just now.

To be fair, I was probably less than 3 hours in and I also come from a time where bootstrapping an app was probably that long sooooo... not saying this is good, but I have done that a dozen times already and I know what to expect.

Bug hunting took an hour or so, nothing major, missing "use client", dumb state management, over complicated logic, a bunch of alerts and prompts, in short, claude's specials (I was spared me the blueish purple gradient this time though...)

Implementing the improvement plan was business as usual and took around another 3-4 hours

```
in @improvements.md implement phase/part ...
```

### One day at a time

I realize this is getting long, and, well it is the end of day 1 so I am going to stop here for now !

At that moment I had a mostly working app, with an admin side i could get in, component and tools could be added.

And as my eyes were all closing, I could not see shadows brewing

Covering me with joy and warm for my app worked like a charm

An innocent small idea that would become ...[find me a noun of something bad finishing by the sound a, i need a rhyme]

In the mean time, here is the [demo](https://cn-registry.dev) and the [repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/cn-registry), feedback greatly appreciated as always !
10:T3674,
## Pourquoi ?

J'ai cherché un truc comme ça et j'ai rien trouvé, alors je le construis !

Je vais en profiter pour le construire en public, autant que faire se peut ! Ca veuut dire que la plupart des prompts et des conversations seront disponibles pour les lire et s'en inspirer !

Pourquoi pas toutes les conversations ? Euuuh alors... bon... parfois, j'oublie. Eeeet euuuh d'autres fois... disons que c'est pas tellement family friendly ^^ ! (Je suis grincheux et irritable par défaut, quand j'ai mal, c'est pire... en ce moment, ca oscille entre 2 et 5 sur 10 ^^)

Je veux aussi montrer/prouver a d'autres qu'il est possible d'utiliser l'IA pour generer la majorité du code avec une "orchestration" minutieuse.

Est-ce que ce sera parfait ? XD quelle question stupide ! NON ! Bien sûr que non !

Est-ce que ça va faire le travail ? J'espère bien !

## Qu'est-ce que c'est déjà ?

C'est une bibliothèque/un marketplace de composants Shadcn ! J'en avais marre de chercher des composants et des blocs sympas un peu partout sur Internet !

Entre la SEO médiocre de GitHub et celle encore pires des sites de développeurs, c'est vraiment pas facile de tomber sur de nouveaux composants, et c'est dommage car certains sont fantastiques !

En plus, en tant que créateur de composants (avec des sites... dont le SEO est affreux...), je me sens un peu invisible, alors [cn-registry.dev](https://cn-registry.dev) est né !

## Le processus

Comme je l'ai dit, il s'agit d'une build in public, alors je vais partager avec vous ce que j'apprends (et mon futur moi si ce con se met a ecouter !).

Comment j'ai fait, ce qui a fonctionné, ou pas, mes conneries, mes espoirs et mes illusions...

En gros, je vais faire des erreurs et avoir l'air d'un idiot pour que vous n'ayez pas à le faire !

Commençons par le début...

### L'idée

C'est souventque je vois des gens demander des idées sur quoi construire, à d'autres, ou pire, à l'IA...

Non... s'il vous plaît, pas ici !

En vrai, l'idéation (oh je vais pas traduire un mot qu'existe pas non plus !) est **la** chose qui nous resteras face machines pour encore un moment ! Faut pas déléguer ca !

"Mais comment trouver des idées alors ?" pourrait me demander mon lecteur astucieux ! Et vous auriez tout à fait raison de le faire !

Alors laissez-moi vous répondre par une question qui pourrait déclencher un peu d'idéation !

Y a-t-il des problèmes à résoudre, là où vous vivez ?

_les 3 phrases d'avant marche tellement pas en francais, mais je les laisse tellement la traduction est moisie x-)_

Traduction en carton à part, résous un de **tes** problèmes mec (ou meuf, z'êtes également les bienvenus !) !

Comme ca, même si personne s'en sert, t'auras résolu un de tes problèmes !

Pour moi, le problème était "dev faignasse chereche composant shadcn facilement" ! Et voila, maintaint, comment on s'occupe de ca ?!

### Plan initial

Rien de révolutionnaire ou de génial, un bete annuaire ferait l'affaire... mais ca manque un peu de pepse... non ?

Problème simple ne signifie pas nécessairement solution simpliste et j'aime deja bien les usines a gaz alors, allons-y !

Pourquoi ne pas ajouter un peu de social ? C'est pas parce que je suis incompétent (ca marche aussi en 2 mots) sociales que les autres le sont !

Comptes utilisateurs, likes, commentaires ! Et hop, maintenant on socialise !

Bon, on a l'idée de base en entier ? Oui ?

Oui ! Et bhe y'a plus qu'a aller embêter une IA avec ça !

### A vos marques, pret, proomptez !

Oui, les prompts sont encores en anglais, ca marche mieux. vraiment !

```
I want to build a website using nextjs 15 and shadcn  (i got the stack figured out !) and I need a complete plan to create the front end !
the project is called "cn-registry" and it will be a registry of shadcn components and tools, because hunting for them feels like a full time job.
I want you to plan the needed components and pages, I aim for maximum reusability so if something make sense standalone, it should be ! i do not want you to create code, just the plan !
I want a home page with carousels, one with the 10 latest components, one with the trending one
components will have a name, a description, a repo link, a website, an installation url, categories and each should have a dedicated page with the copiable install command, the repo readme and github info, some showcase with code toggles
Tools will be the same but the install url might be for an npm package or not exists
I want a search page with card or list results and filters on categories
same for tools but on a different page
I want to have a star rating system and user account where user can see the components they stared
User will be able to comment on components
```

Commeon peut le voir, simple, (in)efficace, (dés)organisé ! Et quelques raffinements plus tard, j'ai mon prompt intermédiaire pour V0 !

Je ne vais pas vous ennuyer avec le prompt interminable (vous avez le lien de conversation dans le repo ^^), mais il était interminable et j'ai pas beaucoup changé de choses !

Apres le passage chez V0, j'avais un prototype de front-end avec des données simulées pour... Mais je vais le mettre où ça moi... ?!

### Sélectionnez votre stack

Perso, je l'ai déjà fait, et vous devriez probablement y penser avant de prompt en vrai ! Pour moi, c'était facile, j'ai pris ma stack par défaut du moment : Nextjs front et back, trpc, tailwind et shadcn.

Oui, c'est ennuyeux. Oui, tout le monde fait la même chose. Je m'en tape le coquillard !

Je commence un milliard de projets (et demi) chaque mois parce que je suis incapable de me concentrer sur une seule chose à la fois, ca veut pas dire que j'ai la de bande pasaante pour apprendre de nouvelles choses à chaque fois !

Il y a aussi pas mal de bonnes docs et ressources pour toutes ces technos, ca facilite le travail meme sans trop d'expérience préalable.

Et pour rien gacher, un gros, Gros (mais genre GROS) bonus : Cela fonctionne bien avec l'IA ! (enfin, des fois, un peu)

Est-ce que je dis que vous devriez choisir cette stack ? Si vous l'aimez, oui, sinon, je m'en fiche complètement !

Choisissez ce que vous connaissez, la nouvelle stack à la mode ou ce qui vous titille ! Vraiment, je m'en fiche complètement, mais je me soucie que vous le fassiez correctement ! Utilisez [better-t-stack](https://better-t-stack.dev) !

Oui, c'est autoritaire, mais si votre stack est dedans, utilisez ca ! 1 commande, boom, projet tout chaud et prêt à decoller en quelques secondes (remercie moi plus tard)

### Laissez la musique commencer !

```markdown
[x] Idée
[x] Concept
[x] projet initialisé
[x] prototype frontend
[ ] plan approprié
```

Ooooh ? Vous pensiez... ? vous pensiez que j'allais ouvrir mon agent IA préféré et commencer à vibe coder ?

uuuhh non non non ! pas la, pas encore ! la, on retourne à notre premier pote qu'on a utilisé pour le plan du front-end et on va lui demander un autre plan !

```markdown
I am using the latest version of drizzle orm and postgres so i would like you to carefully plan the whole complete data model I will need,
including user setting and admin/creator utilities table tha migth be needed in the project. we will iterate to align with my goal but try to makee it very comphrehensive
```

Comme j'ai deja reorientez les choses pour le front end, j'ai eu le droit a un joli plan en one shot, donc...

```
cd workspace/Code/cn-registry;
claude
"I want you to implement the server complete side of the project following this :
  **cn-registry Complete Data Model Plan**
...
  better auth is already setup and running,
  I want schema definition and trpc routes with complete access management for security.
  make sure the apps build when you are done with the backend.
"
```

Et en voiture Simone !

Mis à part les petites reorientations, ca m'a donné un backend "fonctionnel" (a une vache pres !) donc j'ai demandé à l'agent de connecter ca au frontend.

### C'est Bestel, il a mis la cassette et puis pouf !

Vous l'attendiez ? Pour être tout à fait honnête, je ne pensais pas que ce serait si tôt... mais oui, aucun plan ne survit au contact de l'ennemi.

Quel ennemi ? Trpc ! Non non ! pas trpc trpc (c'est très bien trpc !), la version de trpc et le fait qu'une révision majeure est sortie entre la date de coupure d'entrainement de claude et maintenant......

Qu'est ce que donc que ca pourrait il vouloir bien dire toussa ? Les LLMs suivent des schémas qu'elles "connaissent", et devinez ce qu'elles font quand elles connaîssentt pas les schémas ?

Ouep, c'est ca, elles "hallucinent" leurs mamies ! Wooooooot Wooooooot ! -\_- J'espere que vous sentez la douleur !

Mais pour un méchant dans l'histoire, un Héros se présentera un beau soir

Un héros pour aider les dragons à être tués, et son nom est LLM point txt

_eeeett vous savez a quoi on reconnaît des bonnes ryhmes ? elles se traduisent toutes seules!_

```markdown
my stack is using the following package.json files
Agents often fails on trpc usage because their knowledge is out of date.
I would like you to fetch the lates trpc docs and prepare a comprhensive but concise llm.txt for my agents to work with.
it is only destined towards LLM so you can forgo absolutely all the fluff and present information in the best possible way for you to ingest it efficiently
```

J'ai gavé la réponse à mon agent, et après quelques prompts, on m'a servi le cœur du dragon pour le dîner !

### encore, Encore, ENCOOORE

Vous sentez la puissance monter ? L'exaltation de l'accélération par l'IA ? Votre cerveau est-il déjà accro ? Non ? Eh bhe on va devoir travailler là-dessus !

Manque de la doc peut etre ?

Mais tout a fait tout a fait, allons voir ce bon vieux gemini !

je n'ai plus ce prompt, mais c'était quelque chose comme :

```
I am working on this project [description]
the front and backend are prototyped, the apps build but i did not test anything yet.
I would like you to analyze it very (very ! VERY !!) carefully !
you have to open many files to make sure you understand the app and how it is built.
once done, please create some documentation about that.
```

que j'ai invariablement dû compléter après la première réponse par un joyeux (paraphrase exacte)

```
oooOOOOH FFS ! HOW THE F DO YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING, YOU OPENED 5 FILES, 2 OF THEM WERE PACKAGE.JSON ! OPEN ALL THE FILES ! **ALL OF THEM**
```

Sérieusement, qui arrive a bosser avec gemini (vrais question !) ? Bon apres cette petite sceance de fouettage gemini m'as finalement pondus une doc correct !

De quoi, quoi ? Pourquoi j'ai fait documenter le taf par l'IA ?

```
Good. now that you have a complete understanding of the full project, i want you to create a plan to finish the implementation of the existing base.
then, I want you to create a plan in better.md that outlines possible enhancement to the base application.
One I want is a cart system so a user can add component to it and get a complete install command for all the components he selected.
be creative and come up with functionalities that would make this platform stand out
```

Voilà pourquoi ! Pour bien bosser les LLM ont besoin de plus de 2 phrases de contexte, avec une vision plus précise du code, l'IA pourra planifier plus efficacement !

Quelles fonctionnalités et architectures sont utilisé dans des logiciels similaires ? Il le saura ! Z'aurez plus qu'as faire vos emplettes et ca pourras meme debloquer d'autres idées !

### Vous en avez mare de ces details ? et bhe on va vous en débarrasser

Armés de l'étude de gemini sur mon code, j'ai demandé à claude de faire le travail (Faudrais me payer pour laisser gemini s'approcher de ma codebase en ecriture !).

Une fois finis, je luiai demandé de créer un plan plus precis pour les fonctionnalités supplémentaires que j'ai choisies

- système de panier
- système de projet
- intégration GitHub
- profils créateurs

Il l'a tres grâcieusement fait pendant que je commençais à tester l'application.

Click frenetique et topotage systématiques, passage d'erreur en erreur, indexation par petits groupes, envoyé a l'agent qui n'en fait qu'une bouchée !

C'est l'occasion parfaite pour commencer à examiner le code... oui oui, que maintenant.

En vrai, J'y etais depuis moins de 3 heures et j'ai commancé ma carriere a une époque où tout mettre en place pour dev une application prenait probablement aussi longtemps donc...

je ne dis pas que c'est bien, mais ca fait une bonne douzaine de fois que je commence du dev comme ca et je sais à quoi m'attendre en terme de code.

La chasse aux bugs a pris environ une heure, rien de majeur, "use client" manquant, mauvaise gestion d'état, logique trop compliquée, un tas d'alertes et de prompts, en bref, les spécialités de claude (et j'ai pas subi les gradients bleu violacé cette fois-ci ...)

L'implémentation du plan d'amélioration ? Pareil, simple efficace, en 3-4h de plus :

```
dans @improvements.md implémenter la phase/partie ...
```

### Un jour à la fois

Bon... ce post devient long, et comme c'est la fin du jour 1, je vais m'arrêter ici :D !

À ce moment-là, j'avais une app quasi fonctionnelle, avec un côté admin, les composants et les outils pouvaient être ajoutés.

_je vais les laisser comme ca aussi les suivantes, le jours ou l'IA traduit les ryhmes, on est cuit les lapins!_

Et alors que mes yeux se fermaient tous, je ne pouvais pas voir les ombres qui se formaient.

Me couvrant de joie et de chaleur pour mon application qui fonctionnait comme un charme.

Une petite idée innocente qui deviendrait... [trouvez-moi un nom de quelque chose de mauvais se terminant par le son a, j'ai besoin d'une rime].

En attendant, voici la [démo](https://cn-registry.dev) et le [dépôt](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/cn-registry). Vos retours sont, comme toujours, grandement appréciés !
11:T11ee,
Hello everyone, I’d like to introduce LiteChat, a project I created.

[Repository](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat) and download link [here](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases) (available in French, English, Spanish, Italian, and German).

LiteChat is an AI chat application I built to interact with both local and remote LLMs—all within your browser. It’s designed with a "local-first" philosophy, requiring only an HTTP server to run, with everything else handled in your browser! No tracking, no accounts—you bring your own API keys. Data is saved in an IndexedDB database, and you can synchronize your conversations using Git.

Yes, entirely in the browser! 😛 To make this work, I also implemented a virtual file system (again, all in the browser). You can clone repos and include files from the VFS in your conversations! But manually selecting files was tedious, so I integrated tools for managing the VFS and Git.

With the core architecture in place, I added support for HTTP MCP servers. However, standard stdio servers were still missing, so I also built a bridge (rewritten by AI from `mcp-proxy`) to make them work (you can deploy it anywhere, but it’s not secure!).

Sure, AI is fun, but I was getting tired of text-only interactions. So, I added support for Mermaid diagrams and HTML forms (now you don’t even need to think about how to phrase your requests!). Sure, Mermaid diagrams aren’t the prettiest, but since I added a workflow module with visualizations based on [reactflow.dev](https://reactflow.dev), I also included a way for LLMs to generate them! And since plain text isn’t very engaging, there’s also a "Beat" block that uses [strudel.cc](http://strudel.cc/) to add auditory feedback.

Testing was getting repetitive, so I created a prompt library with templates—now you just fill in a form! (Okay, maybe I also needed it for workflows…)

What’s an Agent, you ask? It’s a system prompt, tools, and task-specific prompts! So, you also get a library for those.

Prompts and agents can integrate into workflows (that’s what they’re designed for!), but you also have transformation steps, user code execution, and custom prompts to facilitate transitions.

As you might have guessed, if I have a way to execute code in workflows, why not run AI-generated code? Yes, you can! In Python or JavaScript. And if you’re feeling adventurous, you can run JavaScript in "unsafe" mode (`eval` and all—that’s code for "yolo" 😆). This can produce cool stuff, like [this one-shot Three.js scroll shooter](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html). You can export it in one click (the template is a bit ugly, but I’ll improve it!).

To avoid losing context, all these UI blocks can be "activated" (or rather, suggested) using rules. Of course, you can add your own rules! There’s even a button to ask the AI to pick the best ones for your current prompt.

You also get the usual regenerate (with a different model if you like) and forking options. You can even edit responses manually to remove unnecessary parts. Code blocks are also editable with syntax highlighting for common languages (but no autocompletion or fancy features—let’s not push grandma into the bushes!).

To top it all off, you can organize AI "races" with an unlimited number of participants (though that depends on your budget, haha). It’s great for benchmarking or seeing which model will replace us first. I even built a small tool that takes exported race conversations and turns them into a benchmark site (currently more focused on the JS execution block: [https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html) for the "game" mentioned earlier).

I’m sure I forgot a few things, but you’ve got the gist! 😊

The hosted version is on GitHub Pages, with no tracking and no accounts! You bring your own API keys. You probably won’t be able to use the hosted version for your local LLM due to HTTPS/HTTP restrictions, but as I said, you can [download it](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases) and host it with a simple HTTP server. There are also localized versions for French, Italian, German, and Spanish. A short (and incomplete) tutorial playlist if you’re feeling lost: [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Doe56gCsNRdNyfetOYPQw_JkPHO3XVh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Doe56gCsNRdNyfetOYPQw_JkPHO3XVh)

I hope you enjoy it, and constructive feedback is greatly appreciated! 😊

12:T156f,
Salut a tous, pour mon premier post, je vous presente LiteChat dont je sui le créateur.

[Repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat) et ici [pour télécharger](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases) (en francais, anglais, espagnol, italien et allemand).



C’est un chat IA que j’ai créé pour pouvoir utiliser des LLM locaux et distant, le tout dans votre navigateur. Il est conçu pour être “local first” et n’a besoin que d’un serveur HTTP pour fonctionner, tout le reste c’est dans votre navigateur ! Pas de tracking, pas de compte, vous venez avec vos clé d’API ! Les données sont sauvegardées dans une base de données IndexeDB et vous pouvez synchroniser vos conversations en utilisant git.

Oui, dans le navigateur :P Pour ce faire, j’ai aussi dû implémenter un système de fichiers virtuel (oui, toujour dans le navigateur en utilisant ). Vous avez donc accès aux deux, tant qu’a faire ! Vous pouvez cloner un repo et joindre des fichiers du VFS dans vos conversations !

Mais comme la sélection manuelle des fichiers, c’était une corvée, j’ai intégré des outils pour le VFS et git !

Ensuite, comme l’architecture de base était là, et bien j’ai ajouté le support des serveurs MCP HTTP, mais il manquait toujours les serveurs stdio …, donc j’ai aussi “fait” un bridge (réécrit par l’IA à partir de mcp-proxy ) pour les utiliser (vous pouvez le déployer où vous voulez mais ce n’est pas sécurisé !)

Apres, c’est bien mignon l’IA, mais j’en avais un peu marre du texte seul, du coup, j’ai ajouté le support des diagrammes Mermaid et des formulaires HTML (Comme ca on a meme plus besoin de réfléchir a quoi lui dire a la machine !). Bon… après…les diagrammes Mermaid c’est un peu moche, et comme j’ai ajouté un module de workflow avec des visualisations basée sur [https://reactflow.dev/], j’ai aussi ajouté un moyen pour les LLM de vous en créer ! Et puis comme le text ca fait pas beaucoup de bruit, il y a aussi in block “Beat” qui utilise (http://strudel.cc/) pour aussi en profiter de maniere auditive !

Et puis bon, en testant, toujours taper les mêmes prompts avec juste quelques différences c’était lourd aussi, j’ai donc fait un module de bibliothèque de prompts avec des modèles pour qu’y ai plus qu’a remplir un formulaire ;) (peut etre aussi que j’en avais besoin pour les workflows…)

‘Pis, un Agents, c’est quoi ? hein ? bah un prompt système, des outils et des prompts spécifiques pour les tâches ! Donc ça aussi vous en avez une librairie !

Les prompts et les agents peuvent s’intégrer dans les workflows (duh, ils étaient faits pour ça !) mais vous avez aussi des étapes de “transformation”/exécution de code utilisateur/“prompt personnalisé” pour faciliter le transit !

Comme vous l’avez peut-être deviné, si j’ai une forme d’exécution de code pour les workflows, Est ce que je pourrais t’y donc pas faire tourner le code généré par l’IA, hein ? Eeeeh bha SI ! En Python ou JavaScript Et même que si vous ête un dinguo, vous pouvez faire tourner le js en mode “unsafe” (eval et yolo XD) du coup ca peut produire des trucs (comme ce one shot threejs scroll shooter ) que vous pouvez exporter en 1 clic (le template est moche mais je vais y travailler !)

Afin de n’pas completement obliterer le context, tous ces jolis blocs d’UI peuvent être “activés” (plutôt suggérés ^^) en utilisant des règles. Evidement, vous pouvez ajouter vos règles a vous ! Et meme que vous avez un bouton pour demander a l’IA de les choisir pour vous pour votre prompt actuel !

Bien sûr, vous avez les habituels regen (avec un modèle différent si le coeur vous en dis) et forking, mais vous pouvez aussi modifier une réponse a la main pour dégager l’inutile. D’ailleur, Les blocs de code sont aussi modifiable avec la coloration syntaxique pour les langages les plus courants, (mais pas d’auto-complétion ou autre truc de bogoss, on va pas poussez mémé dans les orties !).

Pour couronner le tout, vous pouvez organiser des courses d’IA avec un nombre illimité de participants (ca dependra de la profondeur de votre portefeuille :P). C’est cool pour faire des benchmarks ou quand on veut voir laquelle des machines prendra notre place en premier… J’ai même fait un petit outil qui prend une conversation de course exportée et qui crée un mini site de benchmark (plus ciblé sur le bloc d’exécution JS pour l’instant https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html pour le “jeu” d’avant)

J’oublie certainement quelques bricoles, mais vous avez compris l’essentiel ^^

La version hébergée est sur les pages GitHub et il n’y a pas de tracking, pas de compte ! Vous apportez vos propres clés API ! Vous ne pourrez probablement pas utiliser la version hébergée pour votre LLM local à cause des restrictions https/http, mais comme je l’ai dit, vous pouvez télécharger https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/LiteChat/releases et héberger avec un simple serveur HTTP. Vous avez même des versions localisées pour le français, l’italien, l’allemand et l’espagnol. Une petite playlist (très incomplète) de tutoriels si vous vous sentez un peu perdu https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5Doe56gCsNRdNyfetOYPQw_JkPHO3XVh

J’espère que vous apprécierez et les commentaires constructifs sont grandement appréciés :D13:T284c,
So, who here builds **React forms** ? And by forms I mean the good kind, with validation, multi-step wizards, conditional logic, and... well, not state of the art things that take you a week to build. 

Yeah... it's ok, we've all been there. I mean, have you ever tried to build a proper form system from scratch ? It's a whole kerfuffle ! Between validation, field types, conditional rendering, and let's not even talk about persistence... 😛

Well, "NO MORE !" I say !

## Meet Formedible

[Formedible](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/formedible) is what happens when you take [TanStack Form v1](https://tanstack.com/form/latest) (which is already pretty awesome) and wrap it in a nice, user-friendly package with enterprise-grade features. It's currently at v0.3.13, so it's early days but it's getting there !

Here's what you get out of the box:

* **22+ built-in field types** - text, email, password, select, combobox, date, time, location, file upload, arrays, objects, and a whole bunch more
* **Multi-page forms** - with progress tracking and step navigation
* **Schema-first validation** - powered by Zod (because we like type safety around here)
* **Conditional logic** - show/hide fields based on other field values
* **Dynamic options** - load options from APIs, filter them, whatever you need
* **Template interpolation** - use `{{fieldName}}` syntax in labels, descriptions, options... it's pretty handy
* **Real-time analytics** - track form completion, field-level analytics, abandonment... the whole shebang
* **Form persistence** - localStorage, sessionStorage, whatever you need to keep data around
* **Visual form builder** - because sometimes you just want to click things together
* **AI-powered form builder** - yeah, you heard that right, AI generates forms for you now
* **Component override system** - customize everything if you feel adventurous

## TLDR

Oh, I know you lot are a bunch of impatient nerds (at least I am...) so here's a quick run down to get going !

```bash
# install the core package
bun add formedible

# or if you're feeling fancy and want everything
bun add formedible formedible-builder formedible-ai-builder formedible-parser
```

Then, a simple form looks like this:

```tsx
import { createFormSchema } from 'formedible'
import { z } from 'zod'

const schema = createFormSchema({
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'name',
      type: 'text',
      label: 'Your name',
      validation: z.string().min(2, "C'mon, give me more than 2 characters !"),
    },
    {
      name: 'email',
      type: 'email',
      label: 'Your email',
      validation: z.string().email("That's not a valid email, mate"),
    },
    {
      name: 'country',
      type: 'select',
      label: 'Where you from ?',
      options: ['France', 'UK', 'Germany', 'Other'],
    },
  ],
})

// use it in your component
import { FormedibleForm } from 'formedible'

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <FormedibleForm schema={schema} onSubmit={(data) => console.log(data)}>
      <FormedibleForm.Field name="name" />
      <FormedibleForm.Field name="email" />
      <FormedibleForm.Field name="country" />
      <FormedibleForm.Submit>Submit</FormedibleForm.Submit>
    </FormedibleForm>
  )
}
```

Easy as pie, right ? Well, hopefully easier than pie, because pie is actually quite hard to make well...

## What's under the hood ?

I've built Formedible as a monorepo with a few packages (because everyone loves monorepos, right ? ... right ?):

- **formedible** - the core library, this is what you'll use 90% of the time
- **formedible-builder** - visual form builder, drag & drop style
- **formedible-ai-builder** - AI-powered form generation (still experimental, but cool)
- **formedible-parser** - parse form schemas and generate different outputs

The tech stack is pretty modern:

* **React 19.1+** - yeah, we're living in the future
* **TanStack Form v1.23+** - the form library that does all the heavy lifting
* **Zod v4.0+** - validation and type safety
* **shadcn/ui** - nice UI components out of the box
* **TailwindCSS 4.1+** - styling, because who has time to write CSS these days ?
* **Turborepo** - managing the monorepo, builds, and all that jazz

## The field types

Right, so I mentioned 22+ field types... let me list the main ones so you know what you're getting:

* **Text inputs** - text, password, textarea, number
* **Selection** - select, multi-select, combobox, radio, checkbox, checkbox-group
* **Date & time** - date, time, datetime, date-range
* **Files** - file-upload, image-upload
* **Special** - location, phone, url, color, rating, slider, toggle
* **Complex** - array, object, nested forms (ooh, fancy)

And if that's not enough, you can build your own custom field types because I've made the thing extensible (you're welcome 😊).

## Multi-page forms

One of the things I'm actually quite proud of is the multi-page form system. It's not state of the art (nothing around here is), but it does the job pretty well:

```tsx
const schema = createFormSchema({
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'personal',
      type: 'object',
      label: 'Personal Info',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'name',
          type: 'text',
          label: 'Your name',
        },
        {
          name: 'email',
          type: 'email',
          label: 'Your email',
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: 'address',
      type: 'object',
      label: 'Address',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'street',
          type: 'text',
          label: 'Street',
        },
        {
          name: 'city',
          type: 'text',
          label: 'City',
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
})

function MultiStepForm() {
  return (
    <FormedibleForm schema={schema} onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <FormedibleForm.Step step="personal">
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.name" />
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.email" />
        <FormedibleForm.Next>Next</FormedibleForm.Next>
      </FormedibleForm.Step>
      
      <FormedibleForm.Step step="address">
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.street" />
        <FormedibleForm.Field name="personal.city" />
        <FormedibleForm.Submit>Submit</FormedibleForm.Submit>
      </FormedibleForm.Step>
      
      <FormedibleForm.Progress />
    </FormedibleForm>
  )
}
```

See ? Not too scary, is it ?

## Conditional logic

This is the bit where things get interesting. You can show/hide fields based on other field values:

```tsx
const schema = createFormSchema({
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'hasExperience',
      type: 'checkbox',
      label: 'Do you have experience with React forms ?',
    },
    {
      name: 'experienceYears',
      type: 'number',
      label: 'How many years ?',
      showWhen: {
        field: 'hasExperience',
        operator: 'equals',
        value: true,
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

You can do nested conditions, multiple conditions, all sorts of stuff. I won't go into all the details here because we'd be here all day, but the documentation has the full scoop.

## Analytics

So, I added analytics because... well, why not ? Sometimes you actually want to know how people interact with your forms:

```tsx
<FormedibleForm 
  schema={schema} 
  onSubmit={handleSubmit}
  analytics={{
    enabled: true,
    onFieldFocus: (field) => console.log('User focused on', field),
    onFieldBlur: (field) => console.log('User left', field),
    onFieldChange: (field, value) => console.log('User changed', field, 'to', value),
    onStepChange: (step) => console.log('User moved to step', step),
  }}
>
```

It's not Google Analytics (thank god), but it gives you enough to understand what's happening with your forms.

## Persistence

Ever filled out a long form, then accidentally closed the tab ? Yeah, me too. It's awful. So I built in persistence:

```tsx
<FormedibleForm 
  schema={schema}
  persistence={{
    enabled: true,
    storage: 'localStorage', // or 'sessionStorage'
    key: 'my-form-data',
  }}
>
```

Now when users come back, their data is still there. They'll thank you. Maybe not out loud, but in their hearts, they're thanking you.

## The visual builder

Right, so if you're not the coding type (or you're just lazy, which I respect), there's a visual builder. It's not the best thing since sliced bread, but it's decent:

```bash
# install the builder
bun add formedible-builder

# run it
bunx formedible-builder
```

It'll start a web interface where you can drag & drop fields, configure them, and export the schema. Pretty handy when you're prototyping.

## The AI builder

Now this one is still experimental, but it's pretty cool. You describe a form, and AI generates it for you:

```bash
bun add formedible-ai-builder
bunx formedible-ai-builder "I need a registration form with name, email, password, address fields"
```

It's not perfect (I mean, nothing is), but it's getting better. Sometimes it gets things wrong, sometimes it gives you weird field types... but when it works, it's like magic ✨

## What I still need to work on

Look, I'm going to be honest with you here (as I should be). There are still things that need work:

* Documentation is... adequate, but could be better
* The AI builder is hit or miss sometimes
* Some field types don't have all the options you might expect
* Performance on very large forms (100+ fields) could be better
* The visual builder could use more polish
* I'm sure there are bugs I haven't found yet (because I'm the only one using it...)

But hey, it's open source and I'm actively working on it. If you find bugs, have suggestions, or just want to say "hey, this is actually pretty good", feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/formedible).

## What now ?

Well, have at it ! Try it out, build some forms, break things, let me know what works and what doesn't.

If you're interested in contributing, there's plenty to do. Documentation, bug fixes, new field types, better AI prompts... the list goes on.

The repository is [here](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/formedible) and the documentation is [here](https://formedible.dev) (well, it will be there once I finish setting it up... it's a work in progress, ok ?).

Thanks for the read and I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D)

{{% goodbye %}}
14:T1e05,
So, you know how everyone's benchmarking LLMs these days? Like, "oh look, this model scored 87.3% on this synthetic test suite" or whatever. Boring, right? I mean, who cares if a model can reverse a string perfectly when you'll never ask it to reverse a string in real life? 😛

That's why I built **RaceBench** — a benchmarking tool that actually tests something useful: how well different LLMs can write real, working JavaScript code. Not some "hello world" nonsense, but actual creative coding tasks — games, visualisations, interactive stuff you might actually want to build.

## The idea (because every project needs an origin story)

One day I was curious: if I ask different AI models to write the same game, which one would actually produce playable code? Not "technically correct but crashes on the third frame" code, but stuff you could run and enjoy.

So I created a benchmark where I ask models to build a 2D scroll shooter game using Three.js. Not exactly "easy mode" for an AI — it requires understanding 3D graphics, game loops, user input, and making everything work together without blowing up the browser. Spoiler: some models handle it beautifully, others... well, let's say it's educational to watch them try 😊

## What it actually does

RaceBench is a static HTML dashboard that displays results from testing various LLMs on JavaScript code generation. Here's the cool part:

- **Real-world benchmarking** — We test creative coding tasks, not synthetic "reverse this string" nonsense
- **Executable results** — Every model's output can be run directly. See the code, click preview, judge for yourself
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** — It's not just "did it work?" We track prompt tokens, completion tokens, TTFT (time to first token), generation time, and success rate
- **Educational value** — Compare how different models structure their code, their approaches to the same problem, and learn from the variety (even the bad ones!)

## How it works (the technical bits, minus the boring parts)

### The setup

Everything's static — pure HTML/CSS/JS with no backend. Deploy it anywhere. GitHub Pages? Sure. Netlify? Why not. Your Raspberry Pi at home? Absolutely. The whole thing weighs about as much as a small hamster 🐹

```bash
# Clone it
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/racebench.git

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (or your jungle site of choice)
# I mean, whatever floats your boat
```

### The test case

The benchmark uses a 2D scroll shooter game built with Three.js as the test scenario. Each model gets the same prompt and has to produce working code. We extract the last ````runjs` code block from each response (because models love to chat before giving you the goods, you know?).

### What we track

For each model, RaceBench captures:

- **Prompt tokens** — How much it needed to understand what we wanted
- **Completion tokens** — How verbose it got with the solution
- **TTFT** (Time To First Token) — Responsiveness metrics
- **Generation time** — Total time to produce the code
- **Success rate** — Did it actually run? Or did it explode?

### The UI (because I care about aesthetics, surprisingly)

It's got this nice dark mode UI that doesn't look like it was designed by a sysadmin in 2003. Two view modes:

- **Card grid** — Pretty cards for each model with key metrics at a glance
- **Sortable table** — For when you want to data-nerd out and sort by TTFT or token count

Click any model and you get:
- Live preview (opens in a new tab, runs the actual code)
- Raw response view (see exactly what the model said)
- All the metrics broken down

## Versions (because software never ends)

### v1: The brave beginning

Tested 18 models. Learned a lot. Realised some models are impressively creative while others are... trying their best. Let's put it that way. 😛

### v2: The refinement

Narrowed it down to 10 models. Better metrics extraction. Cleaner UI. Still watching models struggle with Three.js in entertaining ways.

## Tech stack (kept it simple, you're welcome)

- **Node.js** — Because JavaScript is life
- **Tailwind CSS (via CDN)** — Styling without the build step headaches
- **Simple-Datatables** — For when you want sortable tables but don't want to write them yourself
- **Three.js (dynamic)** — Loaded on demand for the live previews

Minimal dependencies. No complex build pipelines. Just works. I like that philosophy.

## The models (participants in the chaos)

We've tested a bunch of the big names:

- Claude Sonnet 4
- DeepSeek R1
- GPT-4.1
- Gemini 2.5
- Grok 4
- Kimi K2
- Qwen3
- ...and more

Each one brings its own personality to the code. Some are terse and efficient. Others are verbose and over-engineered. A few produce code that makes you question everything you know about software development. All educational in their own way 😊

## See it in action

Don't just take my word for it — go play with the actual dashboard:

**[Live Demo](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/racebench/scroller/index.html)**

Click around. Run some code. See which model you'd want on your team. Spoiler: the answer might surprise you (or it might be exactly what you expect. LLMs are weird like that).

## What makes this different from other benchmarks?

I'm glad you asked (I know you didn't, but pretend you did) 😛

1. **Real tasks, not toy problems** — We test actual creative coding, not "sort this array" nonsense
2. **You can run the results** — Not just a score — actual working code you can inspect and execute
3. **No server needed** — Static HTML means you can host it anywhere or even run it locally
4. **Transparent metrics** — See exactly what we measured and how
5. **Educational** — Compare approaches, learn patterns, see what works (and what definitely doesn't)

## What I learned (because building stuff teaches you things)

- Some models are surprisingly good at 3D graphics code
- Others clearly haven't seen many Three.js examples in their training
- TTFT doesn't always correlate with code quality
- Verbose models aren't necessarily better — sometimes they're just... chatty
- The best model depends on what you value: speed, efficiency, code clarity, or just getting something that runs

## Future plans (the "if I get around to it" section)

I'd like to:

- Add more test cases (different types of creative coding challenges)
- Test more models (new ones keep popping up like mushrooms)
- Improve the metrics (maybe add code quality scoring?)
- Add a "leaderboard" view for those who love rankings
- Maybe, possibly, contribute the data to some broader benchmark effort (if such a thing exists and wants this kind of real-world data)

But let's be honest — I'll probably add a new test case before I remember to do any of that. Priorities, right? 😊

## Wrapping up

RaceBench isn't trying to be the definitive AI benchmark. It's just me trying to answer a simple question: "Which AI writes the best JavaScript code for real projects?" And having fun seeing them all try.

If you find it useful, great. If you learn something from the different code styles, even better. If you just enjoy clicking through live previews of AI-generated games and thinking "wow, that actually works," then I've done my job.

Feel free to fork it, add your own models, test different prompts. The more data, the better. Just don't ask me which model is "best" — that depends on what you're building, your timeline, your budget, and probably the phase of the moon. LLMs are like that 😛

**GitHub:** [DimitriGilbert/racebench](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/racebench)

Now go race some models. May the best code win.

15:T29ba,
So, here's the thing. You know those help platforms where everyone just asks for help and nobody actually... well, helps ? Yeah, me too. They're like parties where everyone brings a plate but nobody cooks anything. Not exactly the jungle site vibe we're going for, is it ?

Well, I had this idea. What if we built a platform where you **actually have to help others before you can ask for help yourself** ? 

Crazy, right ? Or maybe it's actually genius. I'll let you decide.

## Meet Sprynge

[Sprynge](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/sprynge-next) (pronounced like "spring", because I'm terrible at naming things...) is a community-driven help & earn platform built around this simple but powerful idea: **Help 2 to unlock posting**.

The concept is straightforward:
* You join the platform
* You browse help requests from others
* You help at least 2 people (like, actually help them, not just say "good luck")
* Once you've helped 2 people, you unlock the ability to post your own help requests
* When someone helps you, you earn credits (and so do they)
* Repeat forever

It's not rocket science, but it's surprisingly effective at preventing the "everyone takes, nobody gives" problem.

## Key Features

Right, so here's what I've built so far:

### The Reciprocity System
* **Help 2 to post** - the core mechanic. You must complete 2 help actions before you can post
* **Progressive credit costs** - posting more requests costs more credits, which encourages... well, helping more
* **Credit rewards** - earn credits by helping others, completing requests, maintaining streaks
* **Pod system** - users can form groups (pods) to collaborate and share resources

### Help Requests
* **X/Twitter integration** - link your tweets/posts to requests for context
* **Real-time updates** - see who's working on what, live
* **Request categories** - tech, creative, life stuff, whatever you need
* **Difficulty levels** - easy, medium, hard (because some requests are harder than others)
* **Time-based expiry** - requests disappear after a while to keep things fresh

### Real-time Chat
* **Live messaging** - talk to helpers and helpees in real-time
* **AI moderation** - because apparently some people are terrible at being civil (who knew ?)
* **Threaded conversations** - keep discussions organized
* **Notifications** - never miss when someone responds (because we all love notifications, right ?)

### Leaderboards & Gamification
* **Daily, weekly, monthly rankings** - compete with others if you're into that
* **Help streaks** - help people every day to build your streak
* **Reputation points** - earn reputation based on quality of help (rated by people you helped)
* **Badges & achievements** - shiny digital trinkets because why not
* **No exploitation** - the gamification rewards helping, not spamming or gaming the system

### Admin Panel
* **User management** - ban, warn, promote users
* **Analytics dashboard** - see what's happening on the platform
* **Content moderation** - remove inappropriate requests
* **Credit adjustments** - manually fix things when the system goes wrong (because it will, trust me)
* **System health** - monitor Convex functions, database status, all that good stuff

### Browser Extension
* **X/Twitter URL capture** - spot a help request on Twitter ? Capture it to Sprynge with one click
* **Quick status** - see your credits, streaks, and pending requests without leaving the site
* **Request notifications** - get notified when someone posts a request in your area of expertise
* **Built with WXT** - supports Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari (eventually...)

### Email System
* **Email campaigns** - send newsletters, updates, reminders
* **Batch processing** - handle thousands of emails without crashing everything
* **Scheduling** - queue emails to be sent at specific times
* **Templates** - reusable email templates (because writing the same email over and over is painful)

## Tech Stack

I went pretty modern with this one, mostly because I wanted to learn new things (and also because I'm a sucker for shiny new tech):

* **Next.js 15.5** - App Router, server components, all that jazz
* **React 19** - yeah, bleeding edge. Sometimes it hurts, but it's worth it
* **Convex** - this is the real MVP. Real-time database, functions, auth... everything in one place
* **TailwindCSS v4** - v4 is out now, and it's actually pretty good
* **shadcn/ui** - nice UI components, saves me from building everything from scratch
* **Better-Auth** - authentication because, well, you need to know who people are
* **WXT** - for the browser extension (cross-platform extension toolkit, if you were wondering)

### Why Convex ?

Alright, I'll be honest. I chose Convex because I wanted something that handled real-time stuff out of the box. And you know what ? It's actually pretty brilliant.

* **Real-time everything** - updates propagate instantly, no manual websockets or polling
* **Database + functions + auth** - all integrated, no juggling multiple services
* **Type-safe** - full TypeScript support from database to frontend
* **Built-in caching** - it just works, I don't have to think about it
* **Deployment** - one command and it's live. Seriously, it's that easy

The downside ? It's still relatively new, so documentation can be a bit sparse, and sometimes I have to dig through GitHub issues to figure things out. But overall, I'm pretty happy with it.

## The Architecture (Roughly)

So, how does all this fit together ? Well, it's a monorepo (because everyone loves monorepos, right ? ... right ?):

```
sprynge-next/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/           # Next.js app (main platform)
│   ├── extension/     # Browser extension (WXT)
│   └── admin/         # Admin panel (might merge with web later)
├── packages/
│   ├── convex/        # Convex functions & schema
│   ├── ui/            # Shared UI components
│   └── config/        # Shared configs (TS, ESLint, etc.)
```

The `convex` package contains all the Convex functions (queries, mutations, actions) and the schema definition. The Next.js app imports from this, so everything is type-safe end-to-end.

The browser extension talks to the main app via an API, and can also authenticate users using the same Convex auth.

## The "Help 2" Algorithm

Here's how the core reciprocity mechanic works (simplified):

```typescript
// Check if user can post a request
async function canPostRequest(userId: string) {
  const user = await ctx.db.get(userId);

  // Must have helped at least 2 people
  if (user.helpsCompleted < 2) {
    return {
      canPost: false,
      reason: `You need to help ${2 - user.helpsCompleted} more people before posting`,
    };
  }

  // Must have enough credits
  const postingCost = calculatePostingCost(user);
  if (user.credits < postingCost) {
    return {
      canPost: false,
      reason: `You need ${postingCost - user.credits} more credits to post`,
    };
  }

  return { canPost: true };
}

// Progressive posting cost
function calculatePostingCost(user: User) {
  const baseCost = 10;
  const increment = 5;

  // Each request costs more than the previous one
  return baseCost + (user.requestsPosted * increment);
}
```

It's not the most sophisticated algorithm ever written (nothing I write is), but it does the job. The idea is that as you post more requests, it costs more credits, which encourages you to keep helping others to earn more credits.

## Real-time Chat with AI Moderation

The chat system is built on Convex's real-time subscriptions. When someone sends a message, it's pushed to all participants instantly. The AI moderation happens on the server side before the message is stored:

```typescript
// Convex mutation for sending messages
export const sendMessage = mutation({
  args: {
    chatId: v.id("chats"),
    content: v.string(),
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Check for inappropriate content
    const moderation = await ctx.runAction(api.ai.moderateContent, {
      content: args.content,
    });

    if (moderation.isInappropriate) {
      throw new Error("Your message contains inappropriate content");
    }

    // Store the message
    const messageId = await ctx.db.insert("messages", {
      chatId: args.chatId,
      content: args.content,
      senderId: ctx.user._id,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    });

    return messageId;
  },
});
```

The AI moderation uses a simple classifier (I'm using OpenAI's moderation API at the moment). It's not perfect, but it catches the obvious stuff. I'm planning to add more sophisticated filters later.

## What I Still Need to Work On

Look, I'm going to be honest with you here (as I should be). There are still things that need work:

* **Mobile app** - the responsive web version is fine, but a native app would be better
* **More languages** - currently English only, but I'd love to support more
* **Better onboarding** - new users might be confused by the "help 2 to post" mechanic
* **Search & discovery** - finding relevant help requests could be easier
* **Credit marketplace** - let users buy/sell credits (if that's legal... I need to check)
* **Video calls** - sometimes you need to talk to someone face-to-face
* **Skill matching** - match helpers with requests based on their skills
* **API access** - let third-party apps integrate with Sprynge

But hey, it's a work in progress. I'm actively working on it and learning as I go.

## Why "Sprynge" ?

Honestly ? I needed a name and "spring" was taken. So I added a "y" because that's what cool people do these days. But also, "spring" as in "spring into action" and "spring" as in "new beginnings" and "spring" as in... well, I don't know, it sounded good at the time ?

Maybe I should have spent more time on the naming. But then I wouldn't have time to actually build the thing, and where's the fun in that ?

## What Now ?

If you're interested in checking it out, the repository is [here](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/sprynge-next). It's open source, so feel free to:

* **Star the repo** - if you think it's cool (it's ok if you don't, I won't cry)
* **Open issues** - if you find bugs or have suggestions
* **Submit PRs** - if you want to contribute code
* **Ask questions** - if anything is confusing (which it probably is)
* **Tell your friends** - or enemies, I'm not picky

I'm still in the early stages of development, so expect rough edges. But the core idea is solid, and I genuinely believe this reciprocity mechanic could make online help communities actually... helpful.

Imagine that.

Thanks for reading this far. I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D)

16:T2777,
So, who here has **project ideas** ? And among these ideas, some turn into... uh, actual tasks, right ?

Ok ok, so, get me a structured plan, broken down tasks, and anything resembling order, like, right NOW !

Yeah...it's ok, we've all been there 😛. The wasteland of unorganized thoughts is a dangerous place. But worry not, I built us a bunker !

## Welcome to the Bunker 🏚️

[Task-O-Matic](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic) is an AI-powered task management system styled with a post-apocalyptic survival bunker theme (because why not ?). It transforms your chaotic project ideas into structured, executable task lists through AI assistance.

Think of it as your personal task commander in the aftermath of project anarchy.

## The Mission (What it does) 📋

Task-O-Matic is not state of the art — I'm not a bloody AI researcher — but it *does* work and it's rather useful for us bunker dwellers :

- **Idea to PRD generation** : Take your half-baked idea and let AI turn it into a proper Product Requirements Document
- **PRD parsing into structured tasks** : Break down that PRD into actual, doable tasks
- **AI-powered task enhancement** : Let the AI improve, split, and plan your tasks
- **Multi-AI generation** : Run multiple AI models in parallel and compare results (battle royale style)
- **Task execution with external tools** : Connect to Opencode, Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and more
- **Benchmarking system** : Test different AI models with git worktree isolation
- **Existing project adoption** : Attach Task-O-Matic to existing projects (`init attach`)
- **Local-first storage** : Everything lives in your `.task-o-matic` directory (the bunker's archives)
- **Hierarchical task breakdown** : Subtasks, sub-subtasks, sub-sub-sub... you get the idea
- **Streaming responses** : Watch the AI think with reasoning tokens

## The Tech Stack 🔧

Built with a collection of reliable tools that survived the apocalypse:

- **TypeScript** : Because type safety is survival safety
- **Bun** : Fast package manager (needed when running from generators)
- **Vercel AI SDK v6** : The magic behind the AI curtain
- **Commander.js** : CLI parsing (I know a thing or two about CLI tools...)
- **Inquirer.js** : Interactive prompts (for when you need to make decisions in the bunker)
- **Zod** : Schema validation (don't want corrupted data in the archives)

## TLDR (Quick Start) ⚡

Oh, I know you're impatient (me too...), so here is a quick run down to get going !

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Link for local development (optional but recommended)
bun link

# Initialize a new project in your existing directory
task-o-matic init attach

# Generate a PRD from your idea
task-o-matic prd generate "Build a survival bunker dashboard"

# Parse the PRD into tasks
task-o-matic prd parse

# Let the AI enhance your tasks
task-o-matic task enhance --all

# Execute tasks with your AI of choice
task-o-matic task execute --ai claude
```

## Installation 🔨

First things first, let's get you installed in the bunker !

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic.git
cd task-o-matic

# Install dependencies with Bun
bun install

# Make the CLI available globally (optional but handy)
bun link
```

You can also install via npm if you prefer the old ways:

```bash
npm install -g @dimitrigilbert/task-o-matic
```

## Configuration 🔑

Task-O-Matic needs to know how to reach the outside world (AI providers). Set your API keys as environment variables:

```bash
# OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Anthropic (Claude)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key"

# Google (Gemini)
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"

# OpenRouter (if you want access to many models)
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
```

I'd recommend putting these in your `.env` file or shell profile. Don't commit them to git, obviously.

## Workflow Example 🚀

Let's walk through a typical bunker workflow, shall we ?

### Step 1: Initialize Your Bunker

```bash
# Attach to an existing project directory
task-o-matic init attach

# Or create a new project
task-o-matic init new my-survival-project
```

This creates a `.task-o-matic` directory where all your data lives. It's like your bunker's storage room.

### Step 2: Generate a PRD from Your Idea

```bash
task-o-matic prd generate "I want to build a personal finance tracker that works offline, syncs when online, and has a dark mode because the bunker lights are harsh"
```

The AI will interview you (via inquirer prompts) to clarify requirements and generate a proper PRD document.

### Step 3: Parse the PRD into Tasks

```bash
task-o-matic prd parse
```

This breaks down your PRD into a hierarchical task structure. You'll get tasks, subtasks, and sub-subtasks organized by priority and dependencies.

### Step 4: Enhance and Plan Your Tasks

```bash
# Let AI improve all tasks
task-o-matic task enhance --all

# Plan execution order based on dependencies
task-o-matic task plan

# Split a large task into smaller chunks
task-o-matic task split --id task-123
```

### Step 5: Execute Tasks with AI

```bash
# Execute a specific task with Claude
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --ai claude

# Execute all pending tasks with multiple AI models
task-o-matic task execute --all --ai claude,gemini,gpt4

# Execute with external tools
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --tool opencode
```

The AI will read the task description, context, and generate the actual code or documentation. You can review before committing.

## Multi-AI Generation 🤖

One of the cooler features (in my humble opinion) is the ability to run multiple AI models in parallel:

```bash
# Generate solutions from multiple providers
task-o-matic task generate-multi \
  --id task-123 \
  --providers claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --compare

# This will show you a comparison of the different approaches
```

Great for when you want to see different perspectives or verify the best solution. It's like having a council of AI advisors in your bunker 😊

## Benchmarking System 📊

If you're curious about which AI model performs best for your use cases:

```bash
# Run benchmarks with git worktree isolation
task-o-matic benchmark run \
  --models claude,gpt4,gemini \
  --task-set my-tasks

# View results
task-o-matic benchmark results

# Compare specific runs
task-o-matic benchmark compare --run-id run1,run2
```

This uses git worktrees to ensure clean environments for each benchmark run. No contamination !

## Existing Project Adoption 🏠

Already have a project you want to bring into the bunker ?

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd my-existing-project

# Attach Task-O-Matic
task-o-matic init attach

# It will scan your codebase and create initial context
```

Task-O-Matic will analyze your existing code structure and use it as context for future task generation.

## Local-First Storage 💾

Everything Task-O-Matic creates lives in your `.task-o-matic` directory:

```
.task-o-matic/
├── prds/           # Product Requirements Documents
├── tasks/          # Task definitions and status
├── history/        # Execution history
├── benchmarks/     # Benchmark results
└── config.json     # Your configuration
```

No cloud dependency, no data leaving your bunker (unless you choose to). Your data, your rules.

## Streaming with Reasoning Tokens 🧠

When executing tasks, you can watch the AI think in real-time:

```bash
task-o-matic task execute --id task-123 --stream
```

This shows you the reasoning tokens as they're generated. It's fascinating to see how the AI approaches problems (sometimes in ways I wouldn't expect, which is good).

## Why the Bunker Theme ? 🤔

I know, I know, it's a bit weird. But here's the thing:

1. It's fun 😛
2. Projects can feel like chaotic wastelands
3. Having a structured system feels like building a safe shelter
4. "Bunker" is a great metaphor for local-first, isolated development
5. Why not ?

Also, calling users "citizens" and projects "missions" makes me chuckle. If it makes you smile too, then it's worth it.

## Current Status 🚧

Task-O-Matic is in active development at **v0.1.5-beta.1**. Things might break, features might change, but the core functionality works.

If you find bugs (and I'm sure there are nests of them), please open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/task-o-matic/issues). I'm the only user right now, so finding bugs is becoming... challenging 😊

## What's Next ? 🔮

Here's what I'm planning (subject to change based on what the wasteland throws at us):

- [ ] More AI provider integrations
- [ ] Web UI (because some people prefer graphical interfaces)
- [ ] Team collaboration features (multi-bunker coordination)
- [ ] Plugin system for custom tools
- [ ] Better dependency visualization
- [ ] Task templates for common project types
- [ ] Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Get Involved ! 🤝

This is a side project I built because I needed it. If you find it useful, that's awesome. If you want to contribute, even better !

- Star the repo if you like it
- Open issues for bugs or feature requests
- Submit PRs if you want to add something cool
- Share it with other bunker dwellers

## Final Thoughts 💭

Task-O-Matic isn't going to revolutionize project management or anything grand like that. It's just a tool I built to help me (and hopefully you) turn chaotic ideas into organized, executable tasks.

It's not perfect. It's not the most elegant code I've ever written. But it works, it's useful, and it's mine.

If you're drowning in project chaos and need a structured approach to breaking things down, give it a shot. Worst case, you'll have a cool CLI tool with a bunker theme.

Best case, you'll actually ship that project you've been thinking about for months.

Stay safe out there in the wasteland, citizen. And happy coding !

17:T1fcc,
So, who here uses **git** ? And I mean *really* uses it, not just `commit -m "stuff"` and push it when things break ?

Yeah, git is great and all, but sometimes you look at `git log` and it's like trying to read the matrix code upside down. There's so much data there, so many patterns, so many... questions ! Like "who actually broke production last month ?" or "is this repo a one-person show ?" or "why does this file have more commits than my entire project history ?"

Well, I got tired of staring at commit hashes, so I built **git-moar** ! 😛

## What is git-moar ?

[git-moar](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/git-report) is a CLI tool that takes your git repository (or repositories, if you're feeling adventurous) and turns it into a beautiful, interactive HTML report with charts, metrics, and insights that might just make you question your life choices (in a good way... I think).

It's got two main commands:
* **`snitch`** - analyze a single repository (great for stalking... I mean, understanding... a particular project)
* **`scattered`** - analyze multiple repositories at once (perfect for that "oh god, what have we created" moment)

Think of it as git log, but with actual colors, charts, and the kind of data you can show to management without them falling asleep. It's not state of the art, but it sure beats `grep` ! 😊

## TLDR (because I know you're impatient)

```bash
# install the thing
npm install -g git-moar

# analyze your repo and generate a report
cd my-project
git-moar snitch

# or analyze multiple repos at once (wildcards work, 'cause magic)
git-moar scattered ~/projects/*/

# open the report in your browser
open git-moar-report.html  # or xdg-open on Linux, or start on Windows
```

## What's in the report ?

Ah, the juicy part ! The report comes with 15+ chart types and more metrics than you can shake a branch at. Here's the breakdown:

### Quality Metrics (because we all pretend to care)

* **Bus Factor** - how many people need to get hit by a bus before your project dies ? Spoiler: it's probably 1 for most of us
* **Code Churn** - lines added vs deleted, with a "who's actually deleting code" breakdown
* **Health Score** - a number you can use to feel good or terrible about yourself
* **Gini Coefficient** - inequality in contributions, because economics can ruin anything

### Productivity Insights (to prove you're not slacking)

* **Peak Hours** - when do you actually commit ? 3 AM coffee-fueled sessions or 9-5 corporate slavery ?
* **Velocity** - commits over time, with trends and the inevitable "what happened in December" dip
* **Work-Life Balance** - weekend vs weekday commits (prepare to be judged)

### File Hotspots (the drama queens of your repo)

* **Frequently Changed Files** - those files that get touched more than your phone
* **Knowledge Silos** - files that only one person ever touches (a recipe for disaster)

### Other Cool Stuff

* **Commit Classification** - are you writing features, fixes, docs, or just "update" ?
* **Message Quality Scoring** - how terrible are your commit messages ? (spoiler: probably very)
* **GitHub-Style Contribution Calendar** - show off your green squares (or lack thereof)
* **Sortable Data Tables** - filter and sort contributors, files, commits, whatever

## Visualizations

The report uses [Chart.js 4.4.0](https://www.chartjs.org/) for all the pretty charts, and let me tell you, I was pretty proud when I got the heatmaps working. Here's what you get:

* Activity trends over time
* Contributor distribution charts
* Commit heatmaps (hourly, daily, weekly)
* File change patterns
* Code churn graphs
* And like 10 more things that I forgot about because there's just so many

It's got dark/light themes too, because I'm not a monster who forces you to stare at white screens at 2 AM.

## Advanced Features

### Templates (for the control freaks)

If you don't like my beautifully crafted (read: barely functional) default report, you can create your own templates. It's a bit of HTML with some template variables, and if you break it, well... that's on you. I've provided the default template as a starting point, but you can go wild.

### Export Options

Sometimes you need data for spreadsheets (or that executive who demands CSV files for some reason). git-moar can export to:

* **CSV** - because Excel still rules the corporate world apparently
* **JSON** - for when you want to parse things programmatically or feed it into some AI that tells you your repo is doomed

### Multi-Repo Analysis

The `scattered` command is where things get interesting. It can analyze multiple repositories and give you cross-project insights. Want to know which repo gets the most commits across your whole org ? Which contributors are spreading themselves too thin ? Who never commits anything anywhere ? (looking at you, Dave).

It supports wildcards, so you can do things like:

```bash
git-moar scattered ~/projects/*/
git-moar scattered ~/projects/git-*/
git-moar scattered ~/projects/*-backend/ ~/projects/*-frontend/
```

## Tech Stack (nerd stuff)

I built this with:
* **Node.js** - because I'm too lazy to learn Rust (sue me)
* **Chart.js 4.4.0** - for the charts, obviously
* **Simple-Datatables** - for the sortable tables
* **Chalk** - for colorful terminal output (because life is too short for monochrome)
* **SLOC** - for counting lines of code

It's all CLI-based, no servers, no cloud, no subscription fees. Just run it and get your report. Privacy-focused by design (the data never leaves your machine).

## What Now ?

### Install

```bash
npm install -g git-moar
```

Or clone and build if you're one of those people who doesn't trust npm (I get it).

### Run

```bash
# single repo
git-moar snitch

# multi repo
git-moar scattered <path-to-repos>/

# with options (because there's always options)
git-moar snitch --output my-report.html --theme dark --since "2024-01-01"
```

Use `git-moar snitch --help` or `git-moar scattered --help` for all the flags. There's quite a few, and I probably forgot to document some of them, so... good luck ?

### Share

The generated HTML file is self-contained (charts embedded and everything). You can just email it, put it on a server, upload it somewhere, whatever. It's just one file, no dependencies, no nothing.

## The Honest Truth

Look, git-moar is at v0.0.1. It works, but it's not perfect. I built this because I needed to understand my own repositories and the existing tools were either too complex or just ugly. It's a bit of a "grog brain developer" project, but it does what it says on the tin.

I've got a PRD for turning this into a SaaS because apparently people like paying for things that they could just run locally. If that happens, expect more features, fancier charts, and maybe even some team collaboration stuff.

But for now, it's free, open source, and waiting for you to find all the bugs I missed (I'm sure there are plenty).

## Feedback and Contributions

As with all my projects, I'm basically the only user, so finding bugs is getting harder. If you find one, or have a feature idea, or just want to tell me my taste in chart colors is terrible (I know it is), hit up the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/git-report) and open an issue.

Pull requests are welcome too, if you want to fix my terrible code or add something cool. Just... try not to break things too badly, yeah ?

## What's in a Name ?

"git-moar" is because it's git, but with MORE. More charts, more metrics, more stuff. Also I'm terrible at naming things.

It's also published as "git-report" on npm because... well, I forgot to check if the name was taken. Oops. So `npm install git-report` will get you git-moar. I know, I know, it's confusing. We live with our mistakes.

## Closing Thoughts

Thanks for reading this far, and I hope you find git-moar useful (or at least mildly entertaining). Even if you don't use it, maybe looking at your git history in a different way will give you some insights. Or at least some amusing graphs to share at the next team meeting.

Go forth, analyze your repos, and may your bus factor never be 1 !

You can now use a "namespace" for options.

It will create an associative array with passed keys and values !

## Usage

These are the arguments for the `nested` sub command :

```bash
arg-name: nested option namespace
description: positional argument description
--one-of <one-of>: accepted values for keys, repeatable
--complete <complete>: bash built-in completely function, repeatable
--complete-custom <complete-custom>: completely custom dynamic suggestion, repeatable
```

This is how to generate (or add using `parse` !) a script using it:

```bash
parseArger generate --output my-script --nested 'opt-ns "a nested option"';
```

And this is how to use said script:

```bash
./my-script --opt-ns-a "value" --opt-ns-b "b value" --opt-ns-option "my opt" --opt-ns-blabla "lorem ispum";
```

The nested value are in an associative array as follow :

```bash
echo _arg_opt_ns["a"];
# value
echo _arg_opt_ns["b"];
# b value
echo _arg_opt_ns["option"];
# my opt
echo _arg_opt_ns["blabla"];
# lorem ispum
```

## To do what ?

Sometimes when scripting, you are using other CLI programs.

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to pass specific option to that programs, from the CLI, you know, to make your scripts more extensible/user friendly !

## What now ?

I'm heading back to unit test land, so you do you my lil' friend ;)

I just realized I didn't not document the `nested` options, so I just came to do that !

19:Tf96,
I have been toying around with RPIs for years, got a original Model A with a whopping 512MB of ram and the (slooooow) 700Mhz single core cpu. It served me (and my flatmate then) well as a media center for a couple years, then I moved around a bunch and when I settled back (years after), it was time for the RPI 4.

## What do I have

That is what I have right now, a 4 . I considered an 8 GB model, but considering my use case, I'd probably run out of punch before filling the 8 gigs of ram.

It boots off of a usb ssd and has 2 external (NTFS...) drives connected. I also have a DaC pro 2 from hifiberry and it displays out of a cheapo generic 1080p projector I bought from the jungle site on my wall. Yes, it is fine. I watch the occasional DVD so it is fine. I sure would like better but, meh, no coins for that.

## Coming soon hardware

A PI 5 8 gigs should be here before december. It will replace the pi 4 for all on premise stuff. The bump in power justify the 8 GB in my opinion, and with that bump will come a few more software that I will run.

## More powa', more softwa'

I'll have that for sure, we'll see how the pi behaves with this kind of load.

### A git server

This is not the place to explain why I'm starting to be kind of careful with Github, but I am.

So just as a precaution, I will run a git server thing on the updated homelab, you'll have to wait for the article to know which one ;).

### CD stuff

I'd like to  (re-)dip a toe in continuous delivery stuff. It'd help keep my StationIO deployement up to date, build this site automagically, handle recurring task on my (way too) many projects, do whatever, the sky is your oyster (or something) !

If I could eliminate as much sysadmin as possible, hell I'd love that !

### A personal cloud thingy

I didn't pick one yet but OwnCloud, NextCloud, whatever. I might try a bunch and make content about that ^^.

I'd like to be able to simply store/backup documents, access them from outside sometimes, I want a REST api and easy external sync for back up that's pretty much it.

Bonus points for apps (photo management, document edition, etc...) and plugins, but not necessary.

## A door to the world

"Soon"(tm), I should have a fiber connection and should have athe perks thats comes with that,
* a static(ish) IP
* bandwith
* more bandwith

This means, I'll be able to open some of my services to the world. 

I want a PiHole, a VPN and use it as a relay for my weather stations, git server and the cloud thingy to be able to acces them from outside.

In the mean time, my sister's kids are getting older. They just got their first decent computer and start to venture online and I would like to keep them safe, I'll probably end up routing all traffic through me (VPN) with drastic mesure (the great wall of Didi)

Maybe I'll install a few FOSS for social media and communication needs to use with their friends as instagram, FB, X or whatever ARE NOT allowed for now.
Kids are mean and parents are dumb (and/or inverselly proportional), so, yeah, I'm a fascist (the great wall and stuff ^^), whatever you'd like, yeah, they'll probably suffer from something else, but at least, not that.

## MyPi, a toolbox for my raspberry by homelab

Of course, I created a [project](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/MyPi) for that.

TLDR is I want to automate install and maintainance on my Pi, I could have used Ansible or something but I wanted to do it myself using Bash as much as possible.

Nothing fancy for now:
* install/update software using apt, docker and git
* add entry to the fstab
* add entry to the nfs exports
* create folders
* get metrics about the pi (temperature, ram, etc...)

## What now ?

You can expect a bunch of articles about [MyPi](/projects/mypi), the different software I'll use, how I'll use them, scripts creation to make life easier. More random content probably, haven't decided yet.

Definitly some sort of avant calendar (not daily) regarding homelab creation.

{{% goodbye %}}
1a:T231b,
A small article on an mdd update, and the process behind it. Nothing fancy, but a little bit of food for thoughts ;).

## Why is this even a post

First of all, I'm trying to make content ! And, also, I almost went at it "the wrong way", so I thought it would be a good idea to share my experience.

Now, if you never put your foot in your mouth when doing something, you should pass on the read, otherwise, you might find something interesting or at least feel less lonely.

It's on a very small scale and that is why I think it is such a good example. On top of which, you already are familiar with the project so you won't be lost, and also, it's a tutorial project...i'm gonna milk it !

## TLDR

I wanted to go at it fancy, separation between stuff and all, but I ended up doing it the simple way, and it's fine. At least for now.

Yes, it would have worked otherwise, it would have been fine or even great, prepared for improvement and shit, but, a mix of "meh, can't be bothered" and, "hum, i certainly don't need that now..." got the better of the fancyness.

Let's see how it all happened.

## Heads first

* "I should create entry for my projects on the site....huuuuuu, booooorrriiiing...."
* "well, you have a tool for that big dumb dumb" (yes, we are talking to myself, no judgement !)
* "oooh yeah, hum... but it creates article only..."
* "dude, decouple your thumbs from Uranus !"
* "huuuuuu.....OOOOO KKAAAYYY...."

```bash
parseArger generate \
  --output bin/category \
  --help-message "create a new category" \
  --pos 'title "category title"' \
  --opt 'folder "article folder name" --alias directory --alias dir' \
  --opt 'categories "article parent categories" --short c --repeat --alias cat --alias parent' \
  --opt 'date "publication date meta" --short d --alias publication --alias publish-at' \
  --opt 'summary "summary meta" --short s --alias description --alias desc' \
  --nested 'meta "add any meta you want"'
```

And then take that from `article`, and that, oh, and that, and....

## Heeeyy, wait a minute, AKA duh

So, all I did for the last 37 seconds (damn, [parseArger](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger) is SOOOO coool !) is copy pasting article to make a simpler version of it.

Because, when you think about it, categories in Hugo are just articles, but instead onf a `index.md` file, you have a `_index.md`, maybe, just maybe, we could add an option to specify the file name, it would even make `mdd article` more versatile.

To make things a bit more user friendly (yes, you can have friendly CLI !), we'll also add a flag to say it's a category so you don't have to write `--filename _index.md` every time.

```bash
parseArger parse bin/article -i \
  --opt 'filename "markdown file name" --default-value index.md' \
  --flag 'is-category "this is a category, using _index.md as filename" --alias is-cat'
```

Let's modify our `bin/article file to reflect the new constraints.

```bash
# the end of the file 
if [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ] && [ -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then 
  rm "${_container_dir}/index.md" -f; 
fi
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then
	if [ "$_arg_template" == "" ] || [ ! -f "$_arg_template" ]; then
		if [ "$_arg_template" != "" ]; then
			log "template $_arg_template not found" -1;
		fi
		log "using default template" 4;
		_arg_template="${_SCRIPT_DIR}/../templates/article.md";
	fi
	sed \
		-e "s/{{metas}}/$_metas_str/g" \
		-e "s/{{content}}/$_contents_str/g" \
		"$_arg_template" > "${_container_dir}/index.md";
else
	die "file already exists: ${_container_dir}";
fi

# is now 
# if is-category and filename not specified
if [ "$_arg_is_category" == "on" ] && [ "$_arg_filename" == "index.md" ]; then
	_arg_filename="_index.md";
fi

# using _arg_filename instead of index.md
if [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ] && [ -f "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}" ]; then 
  rm "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}" -f; 
fi
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}" ]; then
	if [ "$_arg_template" == "" ] || [ ! -f "$_arg_template" ]; then
		if [ "$_arg_template" != "" ]; then
			log "template $_arg_template not found" -1;
		fi
		log "using default template" 4;
		_arg_template="${_SCRIPT_DIR}/../templates/article.md";
	fi
	sed \
		-e "s/{{metas}}/$_metas_str/g" \
		-e "s/{{content}}/$_contents_str/g" \
		"$_arg_template" > "${_container_dir}/${_arg_filename}";
else
	die "file already exists: ${_container_dir}";
fi

```

That simple, not even 10 lines (6, 6 lines, I counted them on re-read....dawn you braiiiin) ! Definitly worth it if you consider the alternative would have been a new file, with mostly duplicated code.

I could have called `mdd article` in my new command and then renamed `index.md` to `_index.md`, but it did not seem like a great solution to add 500 lines of code and another file for 10 lines of functionality, when i could add 10 (6 I said ! and most of it is modification) more lines and do more.

## Bug fixes and chores

Well, let's test our new toy, shall we ?

```bash
mdd article mdd --cat Projects --is-category \
  --summary "My MarkDown tools, a parseArger tutorial project"
```

Directory and file created ok, let's add an article then.

```bash
mdd article "Story of a simple update" \
  --summary "No plans survive first contact, the best part is no part, check yo' stagin'\!" \
  --h2 "Why is this even a post" \
  --h2 "TLDR" \
  --h2 "Heads first" \
  --h2 "Heeeyy, wait a minute, AKA 'duh'" \
  --h2 "Conclusion" \
  --h2 "What now ?" \
  --cat Projects \
  --cat mdd \
  --tag parseArger \
  --tag mdd \
  --tag devlog \
  --tag bash \
  --tag tutorial
```

aaannnnnd `ERROR 2023/11/05 10:46:34 Rebuild failed: "/src/content/Projects/mdd/Story of a simple update/index.md:4:1": failed to unmarshal YAML: yaml: line 4: found character that cannot start any token`, NOOOPE !

A few minutes of head scratching, couple of copy paste and test and, yup, YAML do not like `\t` for arrays, it wants `  `... fine, what...eeeever.

```bash
if [ "${#_arg_tags[@]}" -gt 0  ]; then
	log "${#_arg_tags[@]} tags specified:" 4;
	_metas_str+="tags: \n";
	for _tg in "${_arg_tags[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tg" 4;
		_metas_str+="\t- $_tg\n";
	done
fi

# is now this
if [ "${#_arg_tags[@]}" -gt 0  ]; then
	log "${#_arg_tags[@]} tags specified:" 4;
	_metas_str+="tags: \n";
	for _tg in "${_arg_tags[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tg" 4;
    # RIGHT HERE, YOOOHOO
		_metas_str+="  - $_tg\n";
	done
fi
```

Aaaand, ....,  it does not crash anymore \o/.

Maybe `article` for the command is not as good now, let's change it to `new` we have to regenerate doc and completion anyway.

```bash
mv bin/article bin/new
rm -f bin/category
```

Edit mdd and modify parsearger declaration to remove `--one-of article`, it won't be remove automagically, even if bin-directory it's on purpose, I'll probably add a flag for this behavior later

```bash
# edit mdd replace
@parseArger pos target "mdd subcommand" --subcommand-directory "bin" --subcommand-run --subcommand-use-leftovers --subcommand --one-of "article" --one-of "new"
# with
@parseArger pos target "mdd subcommand" --subcommand-directory "bin" --subcommand-run --subcommand-use-leftovers --subcommand --one-of "new"
```

A bit of parsing magic before documentation and completion generation.

```bash
parseArger parse -i mdd

parseArger completely "mdd" ./mdd --subcommand-directory ./bin --no-run-completely > completely.yaml
completely preview > completely.bash

parseArger document --file ./mdd  --directory ./bin --title "MarkDown for Didi" > documentation.md

git add bin/new
git commit -am 'ename to new + category creation + tag bug fix'
git push origin main
```

It's now all ready to go \o/.

## Conclusion

Sometimes you don't need a bazooka to kill a fly, sometimes, you don't even need a gun (trust me, if I had access to guns, I'd use that to kill flies, of course I would !) and sometimes you don't even need to kill this fly... BUT not Today !

**heavy hand droping on the table**

Oh no, Today, we squashed the damn bugger by doing almost nothing !

Joking aside, I think that there's a place and time for complexity, but it was not it.

The main objective of this project is simplicity, and adding that much more surface area so early did seem to go against that.

If there is something I realized over the years, fancy don't always mean effective, whether it's a small joke project or a big gargantuous blob of a software and we as `engineers` have a small (tiny, little, puny, dare I say it, nanoscopic !) tendency to want to add complexity, `because`.

Just, be aware of it when you plan your next stuff, and this was a good example ;)

## What now ?

Nothing much, we had a look at updating a parseArger project and went over a bit of KISS principle. 
Maybe it made you realize you went overboard with some of your work ? Do you have a way of alleviating this kind of behavior ? And, do you even care or do you embrace complexity and overkill ?

1b:T2f99,
## Let's create a project together !

I'm one of those `learn by doing` guys (mostly), I'm assuming your kind of are too, so let's build something together.

### A bit of context and basic requirements

For this blog, I'm using [hugo](https://gohugo.io) as a static site generator, and I'm writing my articles in markdown.
`hugo new` does the job, but I want something a bit different, with a folder that contains everything I need for the article (asset, code, etc...).
I would like my new post to be prefilled as much as possible so the tool should be able to set any meta.
Also, I tend to craft my article squeletton before writting (#trauma #school XD), so I should at least be able to add main headings from the CLI.
Because I do not know where this is goping, I won't just `generate` a script, I am going to start a new `project` so I can add more stuff later on.

## Leeeeeet's goooooo !

### Generate the project

We are using the `project` command, more information can be found in the [previous article]() if you need help.

```bash
# create a new project called mdd (MarkDown for Didi. Much creativity, such accronym, #wow)
# one subcommand 'article' for now.
parseArger project mdd \
  --description "markdown tools for my blog" \
  --git-repo "DimitriGilbert/mdd" \
  --project-subcommand article
```

This command will create a new folder `mdd` with the following structure:

```bash
|_ mdd
|_ documentation.md
|_ form.html
|_ Makefile
|_ readme.md
|_ bin
  |_ article
|_ utils
  |_ get_mdd
  |_ install
  |_ webserver 
```

Our entry point `mdd` should handle the command routing on its own, no work needed so we go along to `article`.

### Parse the article command

After some careful thoughts, I have refined my requirements which are now the following:

* create a new folder with the article name
  * if $(pwd) contains a `content` folder, create the article in it
  * article can have hierarchical categories. (if more than one, the previous is the parent)
    * categories make the path to the article
* create index.md from template you can specify
* tags, series, title, draft (on), date (now), summary metas handled by CLI
  * add any other meta you want
* add headings
  * headings level can be specified

From all that, we know that we'll need the folowing :
* arguments : 
  * title (the only thing mandatory, so it's an argument)
* options : 
  * categories (repeatable)
  * folder name (not strictly necessary, but i can forsee a need soooo...)
  * tags (repeatable)
  * series (repeatable)
  * date
  * summary
  * template
  * headings (repeatable)
  * headings level (default 2)
* flags :
  * draft (on by default)
* nested options :
  * meta
    * due to bash limitation, no repeatable nested options, so only the last value for a key will be kept

With that in mind, let's build our `parse` command to update our `bin/article` file. Don't forget to remove comment before executing, they don't play well with backslashes ^^.

```bash
# parse the bin/article file
parseArger parse bin/article \
  # add the title argument, nothing special here
  --pos 'title "article title"' \
  # add the folder name option, using title if none provided. I also declare aliases for this option, namely 'dir' and 'directory'
  --opt 'folder "article folder name" --alias directory --alias dir' \
  # add the categories option, repeatable, with aliases 'cat' and 'parent', a short version of the option is given, namely 'c'
  --opt 'categories "article parent categories" --short c --alias cat --alias parent --repeat' \
  # add the tags option, repeatable, with alias 'tag' and short option 't'
  --opt 'tags "article tags" --repeat --short t --alias tag' \
  # add the series option, with alias 'group' and short option 'g'
  --opt 'series "article belongs to this series" --alias group --short g' \
  # add the date option with short option 'd' and aliases 'publication', 'publish-at'
  --opt 'date "publication date meta" --alias publication --alias publish-at --short d' \
  # add the summary option with short option 's' and aliases 'description', 'desc'
  --opt 'summary "summary meta" --short s --alias description --alias desc' \
  # add the template option with short option 'tpl' and alias 'template'
  --opt 'template "template file to use" --alias tpl' \
  # add the headings option, repeatable, with short option 'h' and aliases 'part', 'h2'
  --opt 'headings "add headings to your file" --repeat --alias part --alias h2' \
  # add the headings level option with short option 'hl' and alias 'headings-level'
  --opt 'headings-level "heading level" --default-value 2 --alias hl' \
  # add the draft flag on by default and with a no-alias as publish 
  #   meaning if you want it off, you can either use --no-draft or --publish
  --flag 'draft "is it a draft" --on --no-alias publish' \
  # add the meta nested option
  --nested-options 'meta "add any meta you want"' \
  # parse in place, -i is the short option
  --in-place
```

This will give us the following `bin/article` file :

{{% fileContent file="/content/Projects/parseArger/My markdown tool, a parsearger project/article_v1" language="bash" %}}

It's a whole bunch of code, but mercyfully you do not have to pay attention to it \o/ (I mean, you can if you want, but it's not necessary).

Instead we are going to focus on the code that is going to use those parsed arguments and stuff !

### The (real) code

Well, let's start fullfilling our requirements !

#### Folder stuff

I use the log function with a level of 4 for comments ;)

```bash
# if nothing else, the title
_container_dir="$_arg_title";

if [ "$_arg_folder" != "" ]; then
	log "folder specified: $_arg_folder" 4;
	_container_dir="$_arg_folder";
fi

# there is categories at least 1
if [ "${#_arg_categories[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
	log "categories specified:" 4;
	_cat_dir="";
	for _cat in "${_arg_categories[@]}"; do
		_cat_dir+="$_cat/";
	done
	log "	categories path : $_cat_dir" 4;
	_container_dir="$_cat_dir$_container_dir";
fi

# hugo directory, it's a poor check , I don't care ^^
if [ -d "content" ]; then
	log "using content directory" 4;
	_container_dir="content/$_container_dir";
fi

# create the directory if it does not exist
if [ ! -d "$_container_dir" ]; then
	log "creating container directory: $_container_dir" 2;
	mkdir -p "$_container_dir";
fi
```

#### Meta stuff

Here we'll handle all the metas so that we can put that to rest.

```bash
# start with the title, it's always here
_metas_str="title: $_arg_title\n";

if [ "$_arg_date" != "" ]; then
	log "date specified: $_arg_date" 4;
	_metas_str+="date: $_arg_date\n";
fi

if [ "$_arg_summary" != "" ]; then
	log "summary specified: $_arg_summary" 4;
	_metas_str+="summary: $_arg_summary\n";
fi

if [ "${#_arg_tags[@]}" -gt 0  ]; then
	log "${#_arg_tags[@]} tags specified:" 4;
	_metas_str+="tags: \n";
	for _tg in "${_arg_tags[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tg" 4;
		_metas_str+="\t- $_tg\n";
	done
fi

if [ "$_arg_series" != "" ]; then
	log "series specified: $_arg_series" 4;
	_metas_str+="series: $_arg_series\n";
fi

if [ "$_arg_draft" == "on" ]; then
	log "draft on" 4;
	_metas_str+="draft: true\n";
fi

if [ "${#_arg_ns_meta[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
	log "other metas specified:" 4;
	for _tmp_k_meta in "${!_arg_ns_meta[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_tmp_k_meta: ${_arg_ns_meta[$_tmp_k_meta]}" 4;
		_metas_str+="$_tmp_k_meta: ${_arg_ns_meta[$_tmp_k_meta]}\n";
	done
fi
```

#### Creating the headings

My article squeletton straight from the CLI

```bash
# empty content by default
_content_str="";
if [ "${#_arg_headings[@]}" -gt 0 ]; then
	_hd_level_str="";
	for (( i=0; i<_arg_headings_level; i++ )); do
		_hd_level_str+="#";
	done

	log "headings specified:" 4;
	for _hd in "${_arg_headings[@]}"; do
		log "\t$_hd" 4;
		_contents_str+="\n$_hd_level_str $_hd\n\n\n";
	done
fi
```

#### Creating the index.md file

Creating the file itself, but, damn, even after *careful thoughts* it looks like I'm missing something....

We'll have to come back to that later i guess...

```bash

# dont erase stuff willy nilly, but, hum, looks like I'm missing something here...
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then
	if [ "$_arg_template" == "" ] || [ ! -f "$_arg_template" ]; then
		if [ "$_arg_template" != "" ]; then
			log "template $_arg_template not found" -1;
		fi
		log "using default template" 4;
		_arg_template="${_SCRIPT_DIR}/../templates/article.md";
	fi
	sed \
		-e "s/{{metas}}/$_metas_str/g" \
		-e "s/{{content}}/$_contents_str/g" \
		"$_arg_template" > "${_container_dir}/index.md";
else
	die "file already exists: ${_container_dir}";
fi
```

befor going any further, let's test what we have so far :

```bash
./mdd article "A test article" \
  --cat my-cat \
  --cat "sub category" \
  -s "this is just a test" \
  --folder "My test article" \
  --h2 "A title for my test" --h2 "a second part to the test" --h2 "Conclusion"
```

Executing this command gives us the following structure :

```bash
|_ my-cat
  |_ sub category
    |_ My test article
      |_ index.md
```

and `cat "my-cat/sub category/My test article/index.md"` :

```markdown
---
title: A test article
summary: this is just a test
draft: true

---

## A title for my test



## a second part to the test



## Conclusion
```

Well, looks like success to me !
Now let's get back to what we missed earlier !

#### Allow ovverride of index.md

Yeah, that's what we forgot, we need to be able to override the index.md file, so let's add a flag for that.

```bash
parseArger parse bin/article -i --flag 'force "erase if exists"'
```

This modify the parsing code so we just need to update the code accordingly :

this : 
```bash
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then
	...
```
becomes that :
```bash
if [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ] && [ -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ]; then 
  rm "${_container_dir}/index.md" -f; 
fi
if [ ! -f "${_container_dir}/index.md" ] || [ "$_arg_force" == "on" ]; then
	...
```

I do it this way if (when ?) we add a backup system ;)

### Nice to haves

Let"s take care of our QoL as developers and help our future selves, let's start with documentation.

```bash
parseArger document --file ./mdd  --directory ./bin --title "MarkDown for Didi" > documentation.md
```

I just pipe the result too the file, je suis un geudin, faut pas me chercher !

Completion is next, and as usual for me, something crashes, the "normal" command is as follow :

```bash
parseArger completely "mdd" ./mdd --subcommand-directory ./bin
```

which fails for me, but I use this workaround :

```bash
parseArger completely "mdd" ./mdd --subcommand-directory ./bin --no-run-completely > completely.yaml
completely preview > completely.bash
```

Why does this work when otherwise fail ? `\_(ツ)_/`

That done, the rc file require creation, this is the content :

```bash
if [ "${MDD_DIR}" != "" ]; then
  alias mdd="${MDD_DIR}/mdd";
  [ -f "${MDD_DIR}/completely.bash" ] && source "${MDD_DIR}/completely.bash";
fi
```

A small detour by the readme file to fill a bit of information :

```markdown
# Markdown for Didi

Markdown tools for my blog.
This is a tutorial project for [parseArger](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger).
```

### Tidy up !

I'll remove the form and the makefile, I don't need them for this project.
And if I end up doing, their just a command away ^^

```bash
rm -f form.html Makefile
```

If you followed along you might have extra directory from your test, don't forget to clean them !
And we're just left with a commit to be done for now !

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
# hub create <repo>
git push origin main
```

## What now ?

I won't re write a heroic fantasy introduction in lieu of conclusion this time, but for real, I kinda have nothing more to teach you on parseArger for now.

As for `mdd`, I'll probably add some stuff to it, but I don't know what yet, so I'll just leave it there for now. [bug report, feature request and PR](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/mdd) are welcome though, I don't promise quick support but I'll sure have a look ;)

I'll probably go over a few other stuff I created before writting again about parseArger, but it'll be back, I promise !

{{% projectInteraction project="parseArger" %}}

{{% goodbye %}}
1c:T2c26,
Now that you can [generate and parse](/projects/parsearger/generate-and-parse/) scripts with [fine tuned arguments, options and flags](/projects/parsearger/more-on-pos-opt-and-flag/), we are going to genrate supporting stuff for our scripts.

## Completion

Completion is a great feature of the terminal that allows you to complete commands, options and arguments by pressing the `tab` key. It is a great way to avoid typos and to discover new commands and options. For me, it is the main selling point on why you should use the terminal.
I use [completely](https://github.com/DannyBen/completely), so  you have to install it before generating the completion script, but the script itself is standalone. 
Here comes the help :

```bash
  command-name: command-name
  file: file
  --subcommand-directory|--subcmd-dir <subcommand-directory>: directory for subcommand target
  --completely-cmd|--cmpcmd <completely-cmd>: completely command, repeatable
  --extra-file <extra-file>: extra yaml declaration, repeatable
  --yaml-file <yaml-file>: yaml file name [default: ' completely.yaml ']
  --completion-file <completion-file>: completion file name [default: ' completely.bash ']
  --run-completely|--no-run-completely: run completely, on by default (use --no-run-completely to turn it off)
          no-aliases: --no-run,
  --discover-subcommand|--no-discover-subcommand: auto run completely on found subcommand
```

Let's have a look a few examples :

```bash
# generate completion for my-script
parseArger completely my-script "./my-script"

# generate completion for my-script and its subcommand in the ./bin directory
parseArger completely my-script "./my-script" --subcommand-directory "./bin"
```

Sometimes, for some esotheric reason, it does not work, but I found a work around :

```bash
# generate completion definition for completely
parseArger completely my-script "./my-script" --no-run-completely > completely.yaml
# run completely preview (that does work) and put the output in the completion script file
completely preview > completely.bash
```

### command-name

The command you generate the completion for

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script
```

### file

The executable file for `command-name`

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script
```

### --subcommand-directory

If your command has subcommands, you can specify the directory where they are located so it will generate the completion as well.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --subcommand-directory ./bin
```

### --completely-cmd

Completely is not installed inyour path ? It runs as a container ? That's ok, you can specify the command to run completely.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --completely-cmd "docker run --rm -it completely"
```

### --extra-file

The completion is generated from the arguments options and flags you defined in your script, but you can concatenate other yaml files to add more completion.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --extra-file ./my-script.completion.yaml
```

### --yaml-file

If the yaml file name does not suit you.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --yaml-file ./not-completely.yaml
```

### --completion-file

Same as for the yaml file.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --completion-file ./not-completely.bash
```

### --[no-]run-completely

Output the yaml file to stdout

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --no-run-completely
```

### --[no-]discover-subcommand

If you have subcommands, you can generate the completion for them as well, but you don't have to.

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script --no-discover-subcommand
```

## Documentation

making things is coll, but making so that others (or you, after a while) can use whatever you put out there is even cooler. But it is also very long and boring. So I made a tool to do some of it for me. I don't use the output as is but it's a good starting point ;).

```bash
  -f, --file <file>: file to document, repeatable
  -d, --directory|--folder <directory>: directory to document, repeatable
  -o, --out <out>: output file
  --tag <tag>: markdown tag for title [default: ' ## ']
  --next-tag-prepend <next-tag-prepend>: prepend to next title tag level [default: ' # ']
  --title <title>: documentation title [default: ' Usage ']
  --title-tag <title-tag>: documentation title tag [default: ' # ']
  --sub-directory|--no-sub-directory: document subdirectory, on by default (use --no-sub-directory to turn it off)
  --append-output|--no-append-output: add to output file if it exists, on by default (use --no-append-output to turn it off)
```

and a few examples :

```bash
# generate completion for my-script
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --out "./my-script documentation.md"

# generate completion for my-script and all the scripts in the ./bin directory, erase "my-script documentatino.md" if it exists
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --directory "./bin" --out "./my-script documentation.md" --no-append-output
```

### --file

Document this file, repeatable. First in first out.

```bash
# generate completion for my-script and my-other-script
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --file "./my-other-script"
```

### --directory

Document all parseArger scripts in this directory, repeatable. First in first out.

```bash
# generate completion for all the scripts in the ./bin and ./I/put/stuff/every/where directories
parseArger document --directory "./bin" --directory "./I/put/stuff/every/where"
```

### --out

If not specified, I will barf all over stdout !

```bash
# generate completion output to stdout
parseArger document --file "./my-script"
# generate completion output to documentation.md
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --out "./documentation.md"
```

### --tag

I shall use a tag for titles, default is ` ## `. But you know, if youd rather have h6, you can do that.

```bash
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --tag "######"
```

### --next-tag-prepend

I start taggin with --tag value, but for each subsequent title, I prepend this value to the tag. Default is ` # `.

```bash
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --next-tag-prepend "######"
```

### --title

If you wanna get fancy with your title, otherwise you'll get a boring ` Usage `.

```bash
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --title "How to use my script"
```

### --title-tag

I already have an h1  bladi bladi blada, whatever ...!

```bash
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --title-tag "###"
```

### --[no-]sub-directory

If you ain't tellin' me, I'll go though your stuff !

```bash
parseArger document --directory "./bin" --no-sub-directory
```

### --[no-]append-output

That is usually how I clean, using a black hole !

```bash
parseArger document --file "./my-script" --out "./documentation.md" --no-append-output
```

## HTML form

Wait, what ?!! Why would a bash CLI script need a form ? Well, it doesn't, but I had the idea of using them for documentation purposes.
They come bundled with some (very dirty) javascript to generate a command from the input so less terminally inclined people can take advantage of your tools too (and maybe, just maybe learn to appreciate it ;) ).

```bash
  file: file to process
  --command <command>: command string, default to file 
  --action <action>: form action
  --form-class <form-class>: form html class
  --input-container-class <input-container-class>: input container class [default: ' form-group ']
  --input-class <input-class>: input class [default: ' form-control ']
  --label-class <label-class>: label class [default: ' form-label ']
  --select-class <select-class>: select class [default: ' form-select ']
  --checkbox-container-class|--radio-container-class <checkbox-container-class>: checkbox and radio class [default: ' form-check ']
  --checkbox-class|--radio-class <checkbox-class>: checkbox and radio class [default: ' form-check-input ']
  --checkbox-label-class|--radio-label-class <checkbox-label-class>: checkbox and radio label class [default: ' form-check-label ']
  --parent-form <parent-form>: parent form for result
  --form|--no-form: display form, on by default (use --no-form to turn it off)
  --button|--no-button: display button, on by default (use --no-button to turn it off)
  --js|--no-js: create javascript, --no-js forces --no-result, on by default (use --no-js to turn it off)
  --result|--no-result: display result, on by default (use --no-result to turn it off)
```

## file

A simple form for a simple file.

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script

```

## --command

If your filename do not match the command you want to run (for alias reasons), you can specify it here.

```bash
# when you do not want to keep things simple
parseArger html-form my-script --command "my-script-alias"

```

## --action

The form does not go anywhere by default, but you can change that !

```bash
# Where I want to go
parseArger html-form my-script --action "/over/the/rainbow"

```

## --form-class

The form uses bootstrap classes by default so it's easy and quick to make them pretty.
I won't repeat it, but it goes for all *-class options.

```bash
# Me no like bootstrap !
parseArger html-form my-script --form-class "my-form-class"

```

## --input-container-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --input-container-class "my-input-container-class"

```

## --input-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --input-class "my-input-class"

```

## --label-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --label-class "my-label-class"

```

## --select-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --select-class "my-select-class"

```

## --checkbox-container-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script  --checkbox-container-class "my-checkbox-container-class"

```

## --checkbox-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --checkbox-class "my-checkbox-class"

```

## --checkbox-label-class

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --checkbox-label-class "my-checkbox-label-class"

```

## --parent-form

When you have sub commands, forms nest into one-another. You can specify the parent form id here.

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --parent-form "my-parent-form"

```

## --form

Then main form id

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --form "my-form"

```

## --[no-]button

On by default, --no- to not create a button

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --no-button

```

## --[no-]js

On by default, --no- to not create javascript

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --no-js

```

## --[no-]result

On by default, --no- to not show results

```bash
# 
parseArger html-form my-script --no-result

```

## What now ?

Completion scripts and documentions are a waiting ! You can now **more than ever** make your bash tools **even more awesome** (or useful, but who cares about that, uh ? ;) ) ! And if you get so inclined as create a GUI for your script, you have a starting point with the html form (I never said it was a good one ^^).
As always bugs and suggestions should go on [parseArger's github repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger).

Thanks for the read and I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D )

See you around and happy coding !
1d:T1f39,
Now that you know the basic of parseArger `generate` and `parse`, it's time to have a look at how we declare arguments, options and flags !

## --pos

Positional arguments are what most of us use in a bash script with `$1`, `$2`, `$...`
Well same thing here, but they have names And much more :

```bash
arg-name: positional argument name
description: positional argument description
--one-of <one-of>: accepted values, repeatable
--complete <complete>: bash built-in completely function, repeatable
--complete-custom <complete-custom>: completely custom dynamic suggestion, repeatable
--subcommand-directory <subcommand-directory>: directory containing subcommands, force subcommand, list parseArger script in directory to fill --one-of
--subcommand-variable <subcommand-variable>: array variable containing subcommand parts, force subcommand [default: ' __subcommand ']
--subcommand|--no-subcommand: is a subcommand
--subcommand-run|--no-subcommand-run: run subcommand, forces sub command
--subcommand-use-leftovers|--no-subcommand-use-leftovers: add leftover arguments to subcommand, forces subcommand
```

And a dumb example that generates a script that take one argument my-cmd and execute it as a subcommand using the leftover arguments, my-cmd must be one of "ls", "cd" or "cat" :
```bash
parseArger generate --pos \
  'my-cmd "an argument" --subcommand --subcommand-run --subcommand-use-leftovers --one-of ls --one-of cd --one-of cat'
```

### arg-name

The argument name, `-` will be replaced with `_` and the variable will be prefixed with `_arg_`.
So --my-super-argument value is assigned to $_arg_my_super_argument.

### description

Simple description for help, documentation and so on

### --one-of

Repeatable, The argument value must be one of, the most basic input validation, yeah !

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "my argument description" --one-of value1 --one-of value2'
```

### --complete

Repeatable, [Completely built-ins](https://github.com/DannyBen/completely#suggesting-files-directories-and-other-bash-built-ins).

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-file "this is a file path" --complete file'
```

### --complete-custom

Repeatable, [Completely custom](https://github.com/DannyBen/completely#suggesting-custom-dynamic-suggestions)

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is an argument" --complete-custom "\$(echo \"some_value some_other you_get the_point\")"'
```

### --subcommand-directory

You been a good kid and you did split your scripts ?
If they're all in the subcommand-directory, parseArger will add them to one of and build a __subcommand variable for you to use.
It forces --subcommand ... in case you were wondering.

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is an argument" --subcommand-directory bin'
```

### --subcommand-variable

Ooooh, oh you don't like __subcommand !!? What should it be called then ? It forces --subcommand.

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is an argument" --subcommand-variable notAsubCommand'
```

### --subcommand

This is a subcommand

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is a command argument" --subcommand'
```

### --subcommand-run

Run the subcommand before handing you the script, forces --subcommand.

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is an argument" --subcommand-run'
```

### --subcommand-use-leftovers

Maybe those leftovers are worth something..., after all ! Forces --subcommand

```bash
parseArger generate --pos 'my-arg "this is an argument" --subcommand-use-leftovers
```

## --opt

I'm pretty sure most of you were waiting for that : (add ethereal music here) options !

```bash
arg-name: positional argument name
description: positional argument description
--repeat-min <repeat-min>: minimum repeatition forces repeat [default: ' 1 ']
--repeat-max <repeat-max>: maximum repeatition forces repeat
--one-of <one-of>: accepted values, repeatable
-d, --default-value <default-value>: value, repeatable
-s, --short <short>: short form
--alias <alias>: option alias, repeatable
--empty-value <empty-value>: value for empty option
--complete <complete>: bash built-in completely function, repeatable
--complete-custom <complete-custom>: completely custom dynamic suggestion, repeatable
-r|--repeat|--no-repeat: repeatable
--empty|--no-empty: use option as flag
```

I won't bore you with arg-name and description, and if you need me too, you might want to re read the previous part a tiny tad more attentively, maybe, if you'd like to.

### --repeat-min

Repeatable option, yes ! but at least this many ! Forces --repeat.

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "this is an option" --repeat-min 42
```

### --repeat-max

Repeatable option, yes ! but not too much ! Forces --repeat.

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "this is an option" --repeat-max 69
```

### --one-of

see --pos --one-of above, it's the same ;)

### --default-value

An option, why not, but it shall not be empty !

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "musnt be eeeemmmmpty" --default-value "this is not empty"'
```

### --short

I know ya'll concerned about bodily efficiency (my mom called that "lazy"...), letters matters ! you got 26 of'em, that's how many options max my scripts have !

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "lazily call me" --short o'
```

### --alias

I know it's hard to always agree (especially with yourself !), with aliases, no more decision (about option names), you can have your cake, and eat it, too !

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'a-opt "lazily call me" --alias "an-opt" --alias "an-option" --alias "needlessly-long-option-name"'
```

### --short

I know ya'll concerned about bodily efficiency (my mom called that "lazy"...), letters matters ! you got 26 of'em, that's how many options max my scripts have !

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "lazily call me" --short o'
```

### --complete

see --pos --complete above, it's the same ;)

### --complete-custom

see --pos --complete-custom above, it's the same ;)

### --repeat

You can now have multiple values for your option. the option is now an array, even if only one value is given.

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "look ma', I'am an array !" --repeat'
```

### --empty

Option or flag ? Well, why not both ? A flag if you don't give it anything, an option otherwise ! 

```bash
parseArger generate --opt 'my-opt "option>flag superposition" --empty'
```

## --flag

Ahoy ! raise the flaaaaaag ! (I'd say I'm grasping at branches, but it seems tree do not grow in the ocean...)

```bash
arg-name: positional argument name
description: positional argument description
-s, --short <short>: short form
--no-name <no-name>: value for the negation
--alias <alias>: flag alias, repeatable
--no-alias <no-alias>: flag negation alias, repeatable
--on|--no-on: on by default
```

You know the drill with arg-name, description, --short and alias, it's up above ;)

### --no-name

`--no-<flag-name>` do not fly ? Fine, you choose !

```bash
parseArger generate --flag 'do-that "flabbergasted, flag a..." --no-name dont-do-that'
```

### --no-alias

There are plenty of ways to say no !

```bash
parseArger generate --flag 'do-that "flabbergasted, flag a..." --no-alias this-instead --no-alias do-this'
```

### --on

It's already on... but you can turn it off.

```bash
parseArger generate --flag 'do-that "flabbergasted, flag a..." --on'
```

## What now ?

Now you almost have the whole view on parseArger, enough for simple scripts anyway !
But maybe you do not value your mental health much and would like to create a whole program in bash ?
Well, What a coincidence, next time we'll have a look at the `project` command, it'll help you do just that ! (the program part, I do not deal in mental health)
As always bugs and suggestions should go on [parseArger's github repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger).

Thanks for the read and I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D )

See you around and happy coding !1e:T1d74,
We [previously](/projects/parsearger/create-bash-scripts-youll-want-to-use) had a quick look at [parseArger](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/parseArger/).
Let's focus on the generate and parse command today !
I tried to make my arguments descriptions fairly clear, but an example is always nice don't you think ?

## Generate

This command will generate (yeah I know, much creativity) a new bash script.
We'll have a look at them one by one but here are the whole lot of arguments, options and flags for the command. (yes, this is the output from --help ^^)

```bash
-p, --pos <pos>: positional argument declaration, repeatable
-o, --opt <opt>: optional arg declaration, repeatable
-f, --flag <flag>: flag declaration, repeatable
-s, --set <set>: declare var, repeatable
-l, --source <source>: file to source, repeatable
-m, --help-message <help-message>: help message for the command [default: ' I send an SOS to the world ']
--help-option <help-option>: help option trigger
--help-short-option <help-short-option>: short help option
--leftovers-name <leftovers-name>: extra arguments variable name [default: ' leftovers ']
--use-shebang <use-shebang>: shebang executable [default: ' /bin/bash ']
--set-version <set-version>: set version number
--version-opt-name <version-opt-name>: version option name [default: ' version ']
--version-short-option <version-short-option>: version short option name [default: ' v ']
--die-fn-name <die-fn-name>: die function name [default: ' die ']
--log-fn-name <log-fn-name>: log function name [default: ' log ']
--verbose-opt-name <verbose-opt-name>: verbose option name [default: ' verbose ']
--verbose-level <verbose-level>: default verbose level [default: ' 0 ']
--leftovers|--no-leftovers: accept extra arguments
--bang|--no-bang: include shebang, on by default (use --no-bang to turn it off)
--version-opt|--no-version-opt: generate version opt handling, on by default (use --no-version-opt to turn it off)
--use-verbose|--no-use-verbose: generate verbose level parser, on by default (use --no-use-verbose to turn it off)
--parse-leftovers|--no-parse-leftovers: parse leftovers, force leftover
```

Forget about --pos --opt and --flag, we are going over them in a different article.

### --set

repeatable, declare a variable at the top of the script.
It can use `$()` to run commands but be careful about escaping (which might cause trouble with parsing sometimes...)

```bash
parseArger generate --set 'my_var="my value"' \
  --set 'my_var_dynamic_var="\$(cat /a/file)"'
```

### --source

repeatable, source a file at the top of the script.

```bash
parseArger generate --source "/path/to/the/file"
```

### --help-message

the script help message. It might be a good idea to make it useful, but you don't have to... 3:-D

```bash
parseArger generate --help-message 'my script does something'
```

### --help-option

option used to trigger help, the fact that you can does not mean that you should.

```bash
parseArger generate --help-option 'not-very-helpful-help-opt'
```

### --help-short-option

short option help trigger

```bash
parseArger generate --help-short-option z
# because why not z ?
```

### --leftovers-name

extra argument array variable name. Forces --leftovers flag.

```bash
parseArger generate --leftovers-name "extra_args"
```

### --use-shebang

specify the shebang, the generated script does not change though, use at your own risk ;).
If you have cross shell compatibility tips and tricks, I am all ears !

```bash
parseArger generate --use-shebang "#!/bin/zsh"
```

### --set-version

give a version to the script, not enforcing any kind of whatever here, you can `--set-version "potato"`, i won't judge

```bash
parseArger generate --set-version "0.1-alpha-preview-48"
```

### --version-opt-name

version trigger option, `--version` by default, but if you hate conventions.

```bash
parseArger generate --version-opt-name revision
```

### --version-short-option

short option trigger for version

```bash
parseArger generate --version-short-option i
```

### --die-fn-name

who wouldn't choose how one dies ? Bar that, I'll let you choose how your script dies.

```bash
parseArger generate --die-fn-name wasted
```

### --log-fn-name

same as die, but I have nothing funny to add, so I think I am just rambling at this point, don't you think ?

```bash
parseArger generate --log-fn-name report
```

### --verbose-opt-name

.

```bash
parseArger generate --verbose-opt-name tmi
```

### --verbose-level

default verbose level for your script

```bash
parseArger generate --verbose-level 42
```

### --leftovers | --no-leftovers

do not waste ! Think about those poor scripts which do not have options.
So you pack all these nice extra arguments and options in an array for later ! And do not read from stdin before you finished it all !!

```bash
parseArger generate --leftovers
```

The array variable is `$_arg_leftovers` or `$_arg_<whatever you chose with --leftovers-name>`.

### --parse-leftovers | --no-parse-leftovers

Force --leftovers and if you hate unordered mess, you can parse the leftovers and look for option like syntax to be extracted in an associative array. How neat.

```bash
parseArger generate --parse-leftovers
```

The array variable is `$_arg_parsed_leftovers` or `$_arg_parsed_<whatever you chose with --leftovers-name>`.

### --bang | --no-bang

use a shebang, on by default

```bash
parseArger generate --no-bang
```

### --version-opt | --no-version-opt

versions are for looooooosers ! #mainOrDie

```bash
parseArger generate --no-version-opt
```

### --use-verbose | --no-use-verbose

when you have nothing to say anyway (or way too many, and you won't stop, and you know you should, but you won't...)

```bash
parseArger generate --no-use-verbose
```

## Parse

Whether it is because you forgot something, "oooh, i might be able to do that..." or "DO THAT !", requirements change, just generating the script is already nice but a way to update it would be nicer, like if we couuuuld... *parse* the script (...).
Like with `generate` command, the whole bunch of options and then details, if you don't find the documentation below, it's because it's the same as `generate`, so look up !

```bash
file: file to parse
-p, --pos <pos>: add positional argument declaration, repeatable
-o, --opt <opt>: add optional arg declaration, repeatable
-f, --flag <flag>: add flag declaration, repeatable
-s, --set <set>: add declare var, repeatable
-l, --source <source>: add file to source, repeatable
--set-version <set-version>: set version
-i|--inplace|--no-inplace: replace parseArger generated content in place
--leftovers|--no-leftovers: add leftovers
--parse-leftovers|--no-parse-leftovers: parse leftovers
```

### file

path to the file to parse, yes it is a positional argument, thank you for noticing the absence of `-`.
You are such an attentive reader :)

### --inplace

update the file directly, goes to stdout by default

## What now ?

Another article is coming to dive deeper in --pos, --opt and --flag options for both generate and parse so you can truly take full advantage of parseArger ;) ! 
But this has been most of my usage, barebones arguments, simple options (and a few flags, not often).
This is such a step up from bash scripts I created in the past, especially with the generated help !
What about you ? Would this help you or are you using other languages when "more complex" scripts are needed ?

Thanks for the read and I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D )

See you around and happy coding !
1f:T1dbe,
So, who here writes **bash** scripts ? And among these scripts, some take arguments, right ? 
Ok ok, so, get me any kind of documentation, usage hint or anything, like, right NOW !

Yeah...it's ok, we've all been there, and if you didn't, you might (not) have had a look at [parsing](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14203146){:target="_blank"} arguments and (AND!) [options](https://sookocheff.com/post/bash/parsing-bash-script-arguments-with-shopts/){:target="_blank"} in a bash script...it's a whole kerfuffle ! Well, "NO MORE !" I say !

## Meet parseArger

[ParseArger](https://dimitrigilbert.github.io/parseArger/) is a bash program to generate standalone bash programs, at least :
* the argument and option parsing (hey, I'm not gonna take your job !),
* and a basic documentation (just the boring part),
* and an install script (...),
* and a bash completion script (...right ?),
* and an html form (whut ..?!)
* *aaaaand* a web server in bash (OH COOOOME ON !)(not really to be used apart from the time you can't do without... I'm just flexing ^^')

## TLDR

Oh, I know ya'll abunch of impatient nerds (at least I am...) so here is a quick run down to get going !

```bash
# download the install script
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger/main/utils/get_parseArger -O;
# make it executable
chmod +x get_parseArger;
# install, use --help for... help...
./get_parseArger --install;
# source bashrc, only needed once, modify according to your shell (if you don't know, it's the good one :D)
source "$HOME/.bashrc"

# generate a project
parseArger project my-awesome-project \
  --description "this is a cool project !" \
  # no commit, push or nothing, for install script generation
  --git-repo "myRandomDevName/my_awesome_project" \
  --project-subcommand my-script \
  --project-subcommand another-script

cd my-awesome-project
./my-awesome-project --help
```

## Install

First things first, let's install the damn thing ! 
Open up a terminal and execute those commands :
```bash
# download the install script
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger/main/utils/get_parseArger -O;
# You are thoughtfully encouraged to spend the next few minutes reading it, just to make sure I do not have nefarious purposes, thank you.

# make it executable
chmod +x get_parseArger;
# install
./get_parseArger --install;
# source bashrc, only needed once, modify according to your shell (if you don't know, it's the good one :D)
source "$HOME/.bashrc"

# check install
parseArger --help
```

More help is available on the install script, just type `./get_parseArger --help` in your terminal.

## Generate a script

Let's start simple with a script that has one argument, one option and one flag. We'll output the generated content to ./my-script.
```bash
parseArger generate \
  --help-message "this is a script" \
  --pos 'my-arg "my argument"' \
  --opt 'my-option "my option"' \
  --flag 'a-flag "boolean flag for my script"' \
  --output my-script
```

You are now free to add your actual code at the bottom of the generated file. It will not be modified if (when !) you update the parsing code using `parse`.
There are more options for --pos, --opt and --flag, I'll dive deeper into that in further articles ;).
Concerning variable created, `-` will be replaced with `_` and the variable will be prefixed with `_arg_`.
So --my-super-argument value is assigned to $_arg_my_super_argument

## Parse a script

Now that we have a script, needs have changed and we miss some options... Let's fix that then !
```bash
# -i (or --in-place) means that we update the file with the newly generated parsing code, keeping your custom code
parseArger parse ./my-script -i \
  --opt 'missing-option "my missing option"' \
  --opt 'another-opt "yet another one"'
```

Done, you you make the code that uses them :).

## Completion script

The best thing about the terminal ? completion ! 
You can't get your mouse on the most likely button you'll need to click in a window (erf, maybe, but ...the usability...).
Well, you can in a terminal :D. Creating the scripts manually though ? Gee..., no !

```bash
parseArger completely my-script ./my-script

source ./completely.bash
```

Remember you'll have to source the completion script to access completion in the terminal, you can add `source /path/to/my-script/completion.bash` to your .bashrc (or .zshrc and so on)

You will need [completely](https://github.com/DannyBen/completely) installed for the generation to work, but once generated it's standalone.

Sometimes, things here do not work as expected and I can't figure out why, if it does for you to, use this as a workaround

```bash
# do not run completely
parseArger completely my-script \
  ./my-script \
  --no-run-completely > completely.yaml

# use the completely preview and pipe to a file...
completely preview > completely.bash
```

## Documentation

We all have that pesky collegue that never remember how to use the oh so fantastic tools that you create (AKA you in 6 months).
Let's think about that guy a bit and throw him a bone with some documentation !

```bash
parseArger document ./my-script --out documentation.md
```

It's not perfect as it is just the command help in a md file, but it's a whole lot better than nothing, eh ?

## Project, anyone ?

You might say that is a whole bunch of mess for a puny script, and you'd be very right !
Who says you have to stop with one script though ? I didn't.
You'd have several ways to do that but I settled on a very opinionated project structure that is as follows

```
.
├── <program>
├── <program>.rc
├── completely.bash
├── completely.yaml
├── documentation.md
├── form.html
├── Makefile
├── readme.md
├── bin
│   ├── command-one
│   ├── command-two
│   ├── ...
└── utils
    ├── get_<program>
    ├── install
    └── webserver
```
And of course I made a parseArger command for that : `project`

```bash
parseArger project my-bash-project
```

Off the bat, it'll create the main program, an rc file for your bashrc, documentation, readme and misc stuff (makefile, installer, webserver, html form). It'll initialize a git repo in the created folder but won't add or commit anything.
With some options, it'll also create the `bin` folder and command scripts, configure the main program to use these commands (as for `generate` there'll be another article).

## What belongs to Ceasar

This project was started because I couldn't find out how to modify [argbash](https://github.com/matejak/argbash).
Most of the work was (well) done so I took the generated output and went at building a similar generator.
It is not as fancy as the original work and a bit of "grog brain developer" display ... but, meh, it works *and it's miiiine*.

On that subject, if you are interested in a more rounded up bash generator thingy, you might want to have a look at [bashly](https://github.com/DannyBen/bashly/), I use completely which is a part of it and it's awesome !

## What now ?

Well, have at it ! Have fun, create awesome scripts with sh load of options !
Also as I am the only user, it's getting hard to find bugs to squash, though I am pretty sure nests can be found.
And if no bugs are to be found, maybe you have a use case I didn't think of and everyone would benefit from.
All that can be done using issues on [parseArger's github repo](https://github.com/DimitriGilbert/parseArger).

Thanks for the read and I hope you found it useful (or at least entertaining :D )

See you around and happy coding !
