summary: Your friendly terminal ssh connection manager
project: sshm0

---

When creating [parseArger](/projects/parseArger), I wanted a way to try my code, and I really hate "hello world" stuff. Learning or trying is a good way to start building new (useful ?) stuff, so I decided to create a small ssh connection manager.

I have, at all time, at leeeeaaast, 3 ssh remotes I go to, can you imagine all that overhead to keep that, in my head.

Now, I just have to remember the name I gave them, how smart is that hey ? On top of which, I barely have to change my workflow, open a terminal, `ssh<up-arrow>[<up-arrow>...]` to find the sshm0 command in history (or `<tab> server_name`, server name is also completed :D), and I'm in.
